<h3 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>No translation of Apicius into English has yet been published. The
book has been printed again and again in Latin and has been translated
into Italian and German. It is unnecessary to here give historic
details regarding the work as Mr. Vehling goes fully and admirably
into the subject. In 1705 the book was printed in Latin at London,
with notes by Dr. Martinus Lister. It caused some stir in the England
of that time. In a very curious book, The Art of Cookery, in Imitation
of Horace&#39;s Art of Poetry, with Some Letters to Dr. Lister and Others,
Dr. Wm. King says:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;The other curiosity is the admirable piece of Cœlius
Apicius, &#39;_De Opsoniis et condimentis sive arte
coquinaria, Libri decem_&#39; being ten books of soups and
sauces, and the art of cookery, as it is excellently
printed for the doctor, who in this important affair, is
not sufficiently communicative....

&quot;I some days ago met with an old acquaintance, of whom I
inquired if he has seen the book concerning soups and
sauces? He told me he had, but that he had but a very
slight view of it, the person who was master of it not
being willing to part with so valuable a rarity out of
his closet. I desired him to give me some account of it.
He says that it is a very handsome octavo, for, ever
since the days of Ogilvy, good paper and good print, and
fine cuts, make a book become ingenious and brighten up
an author strangely. That there is a copious index; and
at the end a catalogue of all the doctor&#39;s works,
concerning cockles, English beetles, snails, spiders,
that get up into the air and throw us down cobwebs; a
monster vomited up by a baker and such like; which if
carefully perused, would wonderfully improve us.&quot;</code></pre><p>More than two hundred years have passed and we now have an edition of
this curious work in English. And our edition has nothing to lose by
comparison with the old one. For this, too, is a handsome book, with
good paper and good print and fine cuts. And the man who produces it
can equally bear comparison with Dr. Lister and more earlier
commentators and editors whom he quotes—Humelbergius and Caspar
Barthius.</p>
<p>The preparation of such a book is no simple task and requires a rare
combination of qualities. Mr. Vehling possesses this unusual
combination. He was born some forty-five years ago in the small town
of Duelken on the German-Dutch frontier—a town proverbial for the
dullness of its inhabitants. There was nothing of dullness about the
boy, however, for at the age of fourteen years, he had already four
years study of Latin and one of Greek to his credit. Such was his
record in Latin that his priest teachers attempted to influence him
toward the priesthood. His family, however, had other plans and
believing that he had enough schooling, decided that he should be a
cook. As he enjoyed good food, had a taste for travel and
independence, and was inclined to submit to family direction, he
rather willingly entered upon the career planned for him. He learned
the business thoroughly and for six years practiced his art in
Germany, Belgium, France, England and Scandinavia. Wherever he went,
he gave his hours of freedom to reading and study in libraries and
museums.</p>
<p>During his first trip through Italy and on a visit to Pompeii he
conceived the idea of depicting some day the table of the Romans and
of making the present translation. He commenced to gather all the
necessary material for this work, which included intensive studies of
the ancient arts and languages. Meanwhile, he continued his hotel work
also, quite successfully. At the age of twenty-four he was assistant
manager of the fashionable Hotel Bristol, Vienna.</p>
<p>However, the necessities of existence prevented his giving that time
and study to art, which is necessary if it was to become a real
career. In Vienna he found music, drama, languages, history,
literature and gastronomy, and met interesting people from all parts
of the globe. While the years at Vienna were the happiest of his life,
he had a distaste for the &quot;superheated, aristocratic and military
atmosphere.&quot; It was at that city that he met the man who was
responsible for his coming to America. Were we writing Mr. Vehling&#39;s
biography, we would have ample material for a racy and startling
narrative. We desire only to indicate the remarkable preparation for
the work before us, which he has had. A Latin scholar of exceptional
promise, a professional cook of pronounced success, and an artist
competent to illustrate his own work! Could such a combination be
anticipated? It is the combination that has made this book possible.</p>
<p>The book has claims even upon our busy and practical generation. Mr.
Vehling has himself stated them:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;The important addition to our knowledge of the
ancients—for our popular notions about their table are
entirely erroneous and are in need of revision.

&quot;The practical value of many of the ancient formulæ—for
&#39;In Olde Things There is Newnesse.&#39;

&quot;The human interest—because of the amazing mentality
and the culinary ingenuity of the ancients revealed to
us from an altogether new angle.

&quot;The curious novelty and the linguistic difficulty, the
philological interest and the unique nature of the task,
requiring unique prerequisites—all these factors
prompted us to undertake this translation.&quot;</code></pre><p>One word as to Mr. Vehling&#39;s work in America. He was for five years
manager of catering at the Hotel Pfister in Milwaukee; for two and a
half years he was inspector and instructor of the Canadian Pacific
Railway; he was connected with some of the leading hotels in New York
City, and with the Eppley and the Van Orman Hotels chains, in
executive capacity. He not only has the practical side of food use and
preparation, he is an authority upon the science in his field. His
printed articles on food and cookery have been read with extraordinary
interest, and his lectures upon culinary matters have been well
received. It is to be hoped that both will eventually be published in
book form.</p>
<p>There is no financial lure in getting out an English translation of
Apicius. It is a labor of love—but worth the doing. We have claimed
that Mr. Vehling has exceptional fitness for the task. This will be
evident to anyone who reads his book. An interesting feature of his
preparation is the fact that Mr. Vehling has subjected many of the
formulæ to actual test. As Dr. Lister in the old edition of 1705
increased the value and interest of the work by making additions from
various sources, so our editor of today adds much and interesting
matter in his supplements, notes and illustrations.</p>
<p>It is hardly expected that many will follow Mr. Vehling in testing the
Apician formulæ. Hazlitt in speaking of &quot;The Young Cook&#39;s Monitor&quot;
which was printed in 1683, says:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Some of the ingredients proposed for sauces seem to our
ears rather prodigious. In one place a contemporary
peruser has inserted an ironical calculation in MS. to
the effect that, whereas a cod&#39;s head could be bought
for fourpence, the condiments recommended for it were
not to be had for less than nine shillings.&quot;</code></pre><p>We shall close with a plagiarism oft repeated. It was a plagiarism as
long ago as 1736, when it was admitted such in the preface of Smith&#39;s
&quot;The Compleat Housewife&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;It being grown as fashionable for a book now to appear
in public without a preface, as for a lady to appear at
a ball without a hoop-petticoat, I shall conform to the
custom for fashion-sake and not through any necessity.
The subject being both common and universal, needs no
argument to introduce it, and being so necessary for the
gratification of the appetite, stands in need of no
encomiums to allure persons to the practice of it; since
there are but a few nowadays who love not good eating
and drinking....&quot;</code></pre><p>Old Apicius and Joseph Dommers Vehling really need no introduction.</p>

<h3 id="preface">PREFACE</h3>
<p>The present first translation into English of the ancient cookery book
dating back to Imperial Roman times known as the Apicius book is
herewith presented to antiquarians, friends of the Antique as well as
to gastronomers, friends of good cheer.</p>
<p>Three of the most ancient manuscript books that exist today bearing
the name of Apicius date back to the eighth and ninth century. Ever
since the invention of printing Apicius has been edited chiefly in the
Latin language. Details of the manuscript books and printed editions
will be found under the heading of Apiciana on the following pages.</p>
<p>The present version has been based chiefly upon three principal Latin
editions, that of Albanus Torinus, 1541, who had for his authority a
codex he found on the island of Megalona, on the editions of Martinus
Lister, 1705-9, who based his work upon that of Humelbergius, 1542,
and the Giarratano-Vollmer edition, 1922.</p>
<p>We have also scrutinized various other editions forming part of our
collection of Apiciana, and as shown by our &quot;family tree of Apicius&quot;
have drawn either directly or indirectly upon every known source for
our information.</p>
<p>The reasons and raison d&#39;être for this undertaking become sufficiently
clear through Dr. Starr&#39;s introduction and through the following
critical review.</p>
<p>It has been often said that the way to a man&#39;s heart is through his
stomach; so here is hoping that we may find a better way of knowing
old Rome and antique private life through the study of this cookery
book—Europe&#39;s oldest and Rome&#39;s only one in existence today.</p>

sketch of the slaves operating a hand-mill. These mills were larger
and were driven by donkeys attached to beams stuck in the square
holes. The bake house is to the left, with running water to the right

bird&#39;s head. The one close to the bowl holds in its bill a stout wire
which is loosely fastened around the neck of the bowl, the two ends
being interlocked. This allows the bowl to tilt sufficiently to hold
its full contents when retired from the narrow opening of the amphora.
The ancients also had dippers with extension handles to reach down to
the bottom of the deep amphora. Ntl. Mus., Naples, 73822; Field M.

<blockquote>
<p>A STUDY OF ITS TIMES, ITS AUTHORS AND THEIR SOURCES, ITS AUTHENTICITY
AND ITS PRACTICAL USEFULNESS IN MODERN TIMES</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone who would know something worth while about the private and
public lives of the ancients should be well acquainted with their
table. Then as now the oft quoted maxim stands that man is what he
eats.</p>
<p>Much of the ancient life is still shrouded and will forever be hidden
by envious forces that have covered up bygone glory and grandeur.
Ground into mealy dust under the hoofs of barbarian armies!
Re-modeled, re-used a hundred times! Discarded as of no value by
clumsy hands! The &quot;Crime of Ignorance&quot; is a factor in league with the
forces of destruction. Much is destroyed by blind strokes of
fate—fate, eternally pounding this earth in its everlasting enigmatic
efforts to shape life into something, the purpose of which we do not
understand, the meaning of which we may not even venture to dream of
or hope to know.</p>
<p>Whatever there has been preserved by &quot;Providence,&quot; by freaks of chance,
by virtue of its own inherent strength—whatever has been buried by
misers, fondled, treasured by loving hands of collectors and
connoisseurs during all these centuries—every speck of ancient dust,
every scrap of parchment or papyrus, a corroded piece of metal, a
broken piece of stone or glass, so eagerly sought by the archaeologists
and historians of the last few generations—all these fragmentary
messages from out of the past emphasize the greatness of their time.
They show its modernity, its nearness to our own days. They are now
hazy reminiscences, as it were, by a middle-aged man of the hopes and
the joys of his own youth. These furtive fragments—whatever they
are—now tell us a story so full and so rich, they wield so marvelous a
power, no man laying claim to possessing any intelligence may pass them
without intensely feeling the eternal pathetic appeal to our hearts of
these bygone ages that hold us down in an envious manner, begrudging us
the warm life-blood of the present, weaving invisible ties around us to
make our hearts heavy.</p>
<p>However, we are not here to be impeded by any sentimental
considerations. Thinking of the past, we are not so much concerned
with the picture that dead men have placed in our path like ever so
many bill boards and posters! We do not care for their &quot;ideals&quot;
expounded in contemporary histories and eulogies. We are hardly moved
by the &quot;facts&quot; such as they would have loved to see them happen, nor do
we cherish the figments of their human, very human, subconsciousness.</p>
<p>To gain a correct picture of the Roman table we will therefore set
aside for a while the fragments culled from ancient literature and
history that have been misused so indiscriminately and so profusely
during the last two thousand years—for various reasons. They have
become fixed ideas, making reconstruction difficult for anyone who
would gain a picture along rational lines. Barring two exceptions,
there is no trustworthy detailed description of the ancient table by
an objective contemporary observer. To be sure, there are some
sporadic efforts, mere reiterations. The majority of the ancient word
pictures are distorted views on our subject by partisan writers,
contemporary moralists on the one side, satirists on the other.
Neither of them, we venture to say, knew the subject professionally.
They were not specialists in the sense of modern writers like
Reynière, Rumohr, Vaerst; nor did they approach in technical knowledge
medieval writers like Martino, Platina, Torinus.</p>
<p>True there were exceptions. Athenaeus, a most prolific and voluble
magiric commentator, quoting many writers and specialists whose names
but for him would have never reached posterity. Athenaeus tells about
these gastronomers, the greatest of them, Archestratos, men who might
have contributed so much to our knowledge of the ancient world, but to
us these names remain silent, for the works of these men have perished
with the rest of the great library at the disposal of this genial host
of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Too, there are Anacharsis and Petronius. They and Athenaeus cannot be
overlooked. These three form the bulk of our evidence.</p>
<p>Take on the other hand Plutarch, Seneca, Tertullian, even Pliny,
writers who have chiefly contributed to our defective knowledge of the
ancient table. They were no gourmets. They were biased, unreliable at
best, as regards culinary matters. They deserve our attention merely
because they are above the ever present mob of antique reformers and
politicians of whom there was legion in Rome alone, under the pagan
régime. Their state of mind and their intolerance towards civilized
dining did not improve with the advent of Christianity.</p>
<p>The moralists&#39; testimony is substantiated and supplemented rather than
refuted by their very antipodes, the satirists, a group headed by
Martial, Juvenal and the incomparable Petronius, who really is in a
class by himself.</p>
<p>There is one more man worthy of mention in our particular study,
Horace, a true poet, the most objective of all writers,
man-about-town, pet of society, mundane genius, gifted to look calmly
into the innermost heart of his time. His eyes fastened a correct
picture on the sensitive diaphragm of a good memory, leaving an
impression neither distorted nor &quot;out of focus.&quot; His eye did not &quot;pick
up,&quot; for sundry reasons, the defects of the objects of observation,
nor did it work with the uncanny joy of subconscious exaggeration met
with so frequently in modern writing, nor did he indulge in that
predilection for ugly detail sported by modern art.</p>
<p>So much for Horatius, poet. Still, he was not a specialist in our
line. We cannot enroll him among the gifted gourmets no matter how
many meals he enjoyed at the houses of his society friends. We are
rather inclined to place him among the host of writers, ancient and
modern, who have treated the subject of food with a sort of sovereign
contempt, or at least with indifference, because its study presented
unsurmountable difficulties, and the subject, <em>per se</em>, was a menial
one. With this attitude of our potential chief witnesses defined, we
have no occasion to further appeal to them here, and we might proceed
to real business, to the sifting of the trustworthy material at hand.
It is really a relief to know that we have no array of formidable
authorities to be considered in our study. We have virgin field before
us—i.e., the ruins of ancient greatness grown over by a jungle of two
thousand years of hostile posterity.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="pompeii">POMPEII</h3>
<p>Pompeii was destroyed in A.D. 79. From its ruins we have obtained in
the last half century more information about the intimate domestic and
public life of the ancients than from any other single source. What is
more important, this vast wealth of information is first hand,
unspoiled, undiluted, unabridged, unbiased, uncensored;—in short,
untouched by meddlesome human hands.</p>
<p>Though only a provincial town, Pompeii was a prosperous mercantile
place, a representative market-place, a favorite resort for fashionable
people. The town had hardly recuperated from a preliminary attack by
that treacherous mountain, Vesuvius, when a second onslaught succeeded
in complete destruction. Suddenly, without warning, this lumbering
<em>force majeur</em> visited the ill-fated towns in its vicinity with
merciless annihilation. The population, just then enjoying the games in
the amphitheatre outside of the &quot;downtown&quot; district, had had hardly
time to save their belongings. They escaped with their bare lives. Only
the aged, the infirm, the prisoners and some faithful dogs were left
behind. Today their bodies in plaster casts may be seen, mute witnesses
to a frightful disaster. The town was covered with an airtight blanket
of ashes, lava and fine pumice stone. There was no prolonged death
struggle, no perceivable decay extended over centuries as was the cruel
lot of Pompeii&#39;s mistress, Rome. There were no agonies to speak of. The
great event was consummated within a few hours. The peace of death
settled down to reign supreme after the dust had been driven away by
the gentle breezes coming in from the bay of Naples. Some courageous
citizens returned, searching in the hot ashes for the crashed-in roofs
of their villas, to recover this or that. Perhaps they hoped to salvage
the strong box in the atrium, or a heirloom from the triclinium. But
soon they gave up. Despairing, or hoping for better days to come, they
vanished in the mist of time. Pompeii, the fair, the hospitable, the
gay city, just like any individual out of luck, was and stayed
forgotten. The Pompeians, their joys, sorrows, their work and play,
their virtues and vices—everything was arrested with one single
stroke, stopped, even as a camera clicks, taking a snapshot.</p>
<p>The city&#39;s destruction, it appears, was a formidable opening blow
dealt the Roman empire in the prime of its life, in a war of
extermination waged by hostile invisible forces. Pompeii makes one
believe in &quot;Providence.&quot; A great disaster actually moulding, casting a
perfect image of the time for future generations! To be exact, it took
these generations eighteen centuries to discover and to appreciate the
heritage that was theirs, buried at the foot of Vesuvius. During these
long dark and dusky centuries charming goat herds had rested unctuous
shocks of hair upon mysterious columns that, like young giant
asparagus, stuck their magnificent heads out of the ground. Blinking
drowsily at yonder villainous mountain, the summit of which is
eternally crowned with a halo of thin white smoke, such as we are
accustomed to see arising from the stacks of chemical factories, the
confident shepherd would lazily implore his patron saint to enjoin
that unreliable devilish force within lest the <em>dolce far niente</em> of
the afternoon be disturbed, for siestas are among the most important
functions in the life of that region. Occasionally the more
enterprising would arm themselves with pick-axe and shovel, made bold
by whispered stories of fabulous wealth, and, defying the evil spirits
protecting it, they would set out on an expedition of loot and
desecration of the tomb of ancient splendor.</p>
<p>Only about a century and a half ago the archaeological conscience
awoke. Only seventy-five years ago energetic moves made possible a
fruitful pilgrimage to this shrine of humanity, while today not more
than two-thirds but perhaps the most important parts of the city have
been opened to our astonished eyes by men who know.</p>
<p>And now: we may see that loaf of bread baked nineteen centuries ago,
as found in the bake shop. We may inspect the ingenious bake oven
where it was baked. We may see the mills that ground the flour for the
bread, and, indeed find unground wheat kernels. We see the oil still
preserved in the jugs, the residue of wine still in the amphorae, the
figs preserved in jars, the lentils, the barley, the spices in the
cupboard; everything awaits our pleasure: the taverns with their
&quot;bars&quot;; the ancient guests&#39; opinion of Mine Host scribbled on the
wall, the kitchens with their implements, the boudoirs of milady&#39;s
with the cosmetics and perfumes in the compacts. There are the
advertisements on the walls, the foods praised with all the <em>eclat</em> of
modern advertising, the election notices, the love missives, the bank
deposits, the theatre tickets, law records, bills of sale.</p>
<p>Phantom-like yet real there are the good citizens of a good town,
parading, hustling, loafing—sturdy patricians, wretched plebeians,
stern centurios, boastful soldiers, scheming politicians, crafty
law-clerks, timid scribes, chattering barbers, bullying gladiators,
haughty actors, dusty travelers, making for Albinus&#39;, the famous host
at the <em>Via della Abbondanza</em> or, would he give preference to Sarinus,
the son of Publius, who advertised so cleverly? Or, perhaps, could he
afford to stop at the &quot;Fortunata&quot; Hotel, centrally located?</p>
<p>There are, too, the boorish hayseeds from out of town trying to sell
their produce, unaccustomed to the fashionable Latin-Greek speech of
the city folks, gaping with their mouths wide open, greedily at the
steaks of sacrificial meat displayed behind enlarging glasses in the
cheap cook shop windows. There they giggle and chuckle, those wily
landlords with their blasé habitués and their underlings, the greasy
cooks, the roguish &quot;good mixers&quot; at the bar and the winsome if
resolute _copæ_—waitresses—all ready to go, to do business. So
slippery are the cooks that Plautus calls one _Congrio_—sea eel—so
black that another deserves the title _Anthrax_—coal.</p>
<p>There they are, one and all, the characters necessary to make up what
we call civilization, chattering agitatedly in a lingo of
Latin-Greek-Oscan—as if life were a continuous market day.</p>
<p>It takes no particular scholarship, only a little imagination and
human sympathy to see and to hear the ghosts of Pompeii.</p>
<p>There is no pose about this town, no <em>mise-en-scène</em>, no
stage-setting. No heroic gesture. No theatricals, in short, no lies.
There is to be found no shred of that vainglorious cloak which humans
will deftly drape about their shoulders whenever they happen to be
aware of the camera. There is no &quot;registering&quot; of any kind here.</p>
<p>Pompeii&#39;s natural and pleasant disposition, therefore, is ever so much
more in evidence. Not a single one of this charming city&#39;s movements
was intended for posterity. Her life stands before our eyes in clear
reality, in naked, unadorned truth. Indeed, there were many things
that the good folks would have loved to point to with pride. You have
to search for these now. There are, alas and alack, a few things they
would have hidden, had they only known what was in store for them. But
all these things, good, indifferent and bad, remained in their places;
and here they are, unsuspecting, real, natural, charming like Diana
and her wood nymphs.</p>
<p>Were it not quite superfluous, we would urgently recommend the study
of Pompeii to the students of life in general and to those of
Antiquity in particular. Those who would know something about the
ancient table cannot do without Pompeii.</p>

<h4 id="three-ancient-writers">THREE ANCIENT WRITERS</h4>
<h3 id="anacharsis-apicius-petronius">ANACHARSIS, APICIUS, PETRONIUS</h3>
<p>To those who lay stress upon documentary evidence or literary
testimony, to those trusting implicitly in the honesty and reliability
of writers of fiction, we would recommend Petronius Arbiter.</p>
<p>His <em>cena Trimalchionis</em>, Trimalchio&#39;s dinner, is the sole surviving
piece from the pen of a Roman contemporary, giving detailed
information on our subject. It is, too, the work of a great writer
moving in the best circles, and, therefore, so much more desirable as
an expert. Petronius deserves to be quoted in full but his work is too
well-known, and our space too short. However, right here we wish to
warn the student to bear in mind in perusing Petronius that this
writer, in his <em>cena</em>, is not depicting a meal but that he is
satirizing a man—that makes all the difference in the world as far
as we are concerned. Petronius&#39; <em>cena</em> is plainly an exaggeration, but
even from its distorted contours the student may recognize the true
lines of an ancient meal.</p>
<p>There is, not so well-known a beautiful picture of an Athenian dinner
party which must not be overlooked, for it contains a wealth of
information. Although Greek, we learn from it much of the Roman
conditions. Anacharsis&#39; description of a banquet at Athens, dating
back to the fourth century B.C. about the time when the Periclean
régime flourished, is worth your perusal. A particularly good version
of this tale is rendered by Baron Vaerst in his book &quot;Gastrosophie,&quot;
Leipzig, 1854, who has based his version on the original translation
from the Greek, entitled, <em>Voyage du jeune Anacharsis en Grèce vers le
milieu du quatrième siècle avant l&#39;ère vulgaire par J. J. Barthélemy</em>,
Paris, 1824. Vaerst has amplified the excerpts from the young
traveler&#39;s observations by quotations from other ancient Greek writers
upon the subject, thus giving us a most beautiful and authentic ideal
description of Greek table manners and habits when Athens had reached
the height in culture, refinement and political greatness.</p>
<p>Anacharsis was not a Hellene but a Scythian visitor. By his own
admission he is no authority on Grecian cookery, but as a reporter he
excels.</p>
<p>This truly Hellenic discussion of the art of eating and living at the
table of the cultured Athenians is the most profound discourse we know
of, ancient or modern, on eating. The wisdom revealed in this tale is
lasting, and, like Greek marble, consummate in external beauty and
inner worth.</p>
<p>We thus possess the testimony of two contemporary writers which
together with the book of Apicius and with what we learn from
Athenaeus should give a fair picture of ancient eating and cookery.</p>
<p>Apicius is our most substantial witness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this source has not been spared by meddlesome men, and
it has not reached us in its pristine condition. As a matter of fact,
Apicius has been badly mauled throughout the centuries. This book has
always attracted attention, never has it met with indifference. In the
middle ages it became the object of intensive study, interpretation,
controversy—in short it has attracted interest that has lasted into
modern times.</p>
<p>When, with the advent of the dark ages, it ceased to be a practical
cookery book, it became a treasure cherished by the few who preserved
the classical literature, and after the invention of printing it
became the object of curiosity, even mystery. Some interpreters waxed
enthusiastic over it, others who failed to understand it, condemned it
as hopeless and worthless.</p>
<p>The pages of our Apiciana plainly show the lasting interest in our
ancient book, particularly ever since its presence became a matter of
common knowledge during the first century of printing.</p>
<p>The Apicius book is the most ancient of European cookery books.
However, Platina&#39;s work, <em>de honesta uolvptate</em>, is the first cookery
book to appear in print. Platina, in 1474, was more up-to-date. His
book had a larger circulation. But its vogue stopped after a century
while Apicius marched on through centuries to come, tantalizing the
scholars, amusing the curious gourmets if not educated cooks to the
present day.</p>
<p>APICIUS, THE MAN</p>
<p>Who was Apicius? This is the surname of several renowned gastronomers
of old Rome. There are many references and anecdotes in ancient
literature to men bearing this name. Two Apicii have definitely been
accounted for. The older one, Marcus A. lived at the time of Sulla
about 100 B.C. The man we are most interested in, M. Gabius Apicius,
lived under Augustus and Tiberius, 80 B.C. to A.D. 40. However, both
these men had a reputation for their good table.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="athenaeus-on-apicius">ATHENAEUS ON APICIUS</h3>
<p>It is worth noting that the well-read Athenaeus, conversant with most
authors of Antiquity makes no mention of the Apicius book. This
collection of recipes, then, was not in general circulation during
Athenaei time (beginning of the third century of our era), that,
maybe, it was kept a secret by some Roman cooks. On the other hand it
is possible that the Apicius book did not exist during the time of
Athenaeus in the form handed down to us and that the monographs on
various departments of cookery (most of them of Greek origin, works of
which indeed Athenaeus speaks) were collected after the first quarter
of the third century and were adorned with the name of Apicius merely
because his fame as a gourmet had endured.</p>
<p>What Athenaeus knows about Apicius (one of three known famous eaters
bearing that name) is the following:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;About the time of Tiberius [42 B.C.-37 A.D.] there
lived a man, named Apicius; very rich and luxurious, for
whom several kinds of cheesecake called Apician, are
named [not found in our present A.]. He spent myriads of
drachmas on his belly, living chiefly at Minturnæ, a
city of Campania, eating very expensive crawfish, which
are found in that place superior in size to those of
Smyrna, or even to the crabs of Alexandria. Hearing,
too, that they were very large in Africa, he sailed
thither, without waiting a single day, and suffered
exceedingly on his voyage. But when he came near the
coast, before he disembarked (for his arrival made a
great stir among the Africans) the fishermen came
alongside in their boats and brought him some very fine
crawfish; and he, when he saw them, asked if they had
any finer; and when they said that there were none finer
than those which they had brought, he, recollecting
those at Minturnæ ordered the master of the ship to sail
back the same way into Italy, without going near the
land....

&quot;When the emperor Trajan [A.D. 52 or 53-117] was in
Parthia [a country in Asia, part of Persia?] at a
distance of many days from the sea, Apicius sent him
fresh oysters, which he had kept so by a clever
contrivance of his own; real oysters....&quot;</code></pre><p>(The instructions given in our Apicius book, Recipe 14, for the
keeping of oysters would hardly guarantee their safe arrival on such
a journey as described above.)</p>
<p>Athenaeus tells us further that many of the Apician recipes were
famous and that many dishes were named after him. This confirms the
theory that Apicius was not the author of the present book but that
the book was dedicated to him by an unknown author or compiler.
Athenaeus also mentions one Apion who wrote a book on luxurious
living. Whether this man is identical with the author or patron of our
book is problematic. Torinus, in his <em>epistola dedicatoria</em> to the
1541 edition expresses the same doubt.</p>
<p>Marcus Gabius (or Gavius) Apicius lived during Rome&#39;s most interesting
epoch, when the empire had reached its highest point, when the seeds
of decline, not yet apparent, were in the ground, when in the quiet
villages of that far-off province, Palestine, the Saviour&#39;s doctrines
fascinated humble audiences—teachings that later reaching the very
heart of the world&#39;s mistress were destined to tarnish the splendor of
that autocrat.</p>
<p>According to the mention by various writers, this man, M. Gabius
Apicius, was one of the many ancient gastronomers who took the subject
of food seriously. Assuming a scientific attitude towards eating and
food they were criticised for paying too much attention to their
table. This was considered a superfluous and indeed wicked luxury when
frugality was a virtue. These men who knew by intuition the importance
of knowing something about nutrition are only now being vindicated by
the findings of modern science.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="chapter-m">Chapter M.</h4>
<h3 id="gabius-apicius-this-most-famous-of-the-celebrated-and-much">Gabius Apicius, this most famous of the celebrated and much</h3>
<p>maligned bon-vivants, quite naturally took great interest in the
preparation of food. He is said to have originated many dishes
himself; he collected much material on the subject and he endowed a
school for the teaching of cookery and for the promotion of culinary
ideas. This very statement by his critics places him high in our
esteem, as it shows him up as a scientist and educator. He spent his
vast fortune for food, as the stories go, and when he had only a
quarter million dollars left (a paltry sum today but a considerable
one in those days when gold was scarce and monetary standards in a
worse muddle than today) Apicius took his own life, fearing that he
might have to starve to death some day.</p>
<p>This story seems absurd on the face of it, yet Seneca and Martial tell
it (both with different tendencies) and Suidas, Albino and other
writers repeat it without critical analysis. These writers who are
unreliable in culinary matters anyway, claim that Apicius spent one
hundred million <em>sestertii</em> on his appetite—<em>in gulam</em>. Finally when
the hour of accounting came he found that there were only ten million
<em>sestertii</em> left, so he concluded that life was not worth living if
his gastronomic ideas could no longer be carried out in the accustomed
and approved style, and he took poison at a banquet especially
arranged for the occasion.</p>
<p>In the light of modern experience with psychology, with economics,
depressions, journalism, we focus on this and similar stories, and we
find them thoroughly unreliable. We cannot believe this one. It is too
melodramatic, too moralistic perhaps to suit our modern taste. The
underlying causes for the conduct, life and end of Apicius have not
been told. Of course, we have to accept the facts as reported. If only
a Petronius had written that story! What a story it might have been!
But there is only one Petronius in antiquity. His Trimalchio, former
slave, successful profiteer and food speculator, braggard and
drunkard, wife-beater—an upstart who arranged extravagant banquets
merely to show off, who, by the way, also arranged for his funeral at
his banquet (Apician fashion and, indeed, Petronian fashion! for
Petronius died in the same manner) and who peacefully &quot;passed out&quot;
soundly intoxicated—this man is a figure true to life as it was then,
as it is now and as it probably will continue to be. Last but not
least: Mrs. Trimalchio, the resolute lady who helped him &quot;make his
pile&quot;—these are human characters much more real, much more
trustworthy than anything and everything else ever depicted by any
ancient pen; they bring out so graphically the modernity of antiquity.
Without Petronius and Pompeii the antique world would forever remain
at an inexplicably remote distance to our modern conception of life.
With him, and with the dead city, the riddles of antiquity are cleared
up.</p>
<p>THE BOOK</p>
<p>Many dishes listed in Apicius are named for various celebrities who
flourished at a later date than the second Apicius. It is noteworthy,
however, that neither such close contemporaries as Heliogabalus and
Nero, notorious gluttons, nor Petronius, the arbiter of fashion of the
period, are among the persons thus honored. Vitellius, a later
glutton, is well represented in the book. It is fair to assume, then,
that the author or collector of our present Apicius lived long after
the second Apicius, or, at least, that the book was augmented by
persons posterior to M. Gabius A. The book in its present state was
probably completed about the latter part of the third century. It is
almost certain that many recipes were added to a much earlier edition.</p>
<p>PROBABLY OF GREEK PARENTAGE</p>
<p>We may as well add another to the many speculations by saying that it
is quite probable for our book to originate in a number of Greek
manuals or monographs on specialized subjects or departments of
cookery. Such special treatises are mentioned by Athenaeus (cf.
Humelbergius, quoted by Lister). The titles of each chapter (or book)
are in Greek, the text is full of Greek terminology. While
classification under the respective titles is not strictly adhered to
at all times, it is significant that certain subjects, that of fish
cookery, for instance, appear twice in the book, the same subject
showing treatment by widely different hands. Still more significant is
the absence in our book of such important departments as
desserts—_dulcia_—confections in which the ancients were experts.
Bakery, too, even the plainest kind, is conspicuously absent in the
Apician books. The latter two trades being particularly well
developed, were departmentalized to an astonishing degree in ancient
Greece and Rome. These indispensable books are simply wanting in our
book if it be but a collection of Greek monographs. Roman culture and
refinement of living, commencing about 200-250 years before our era
was under the complete rule of Hellas. Greek influence included
everybody from philosophers, artists, architects, actors, law-makers
to cooks.</p>
<p>&quot;The conquered thus conquered the conquerors.&quot;</p>
<p>Humelbergius makes a significant reference to the origin of Apicius.
We confess, we have not checked up this worthy editor nor his
successor, Dr. Lister, whom he quotes in the preface as to the origin
of our book. With reference to Plato&#39;s work, Humelbergius says:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;_Que res tota spectat medicinæ partem, quæ diaitetike
appelatur, et victu medetur: at in hac tes diaitetikes
parte totus est Apicius noster._&quot;</code></pre><p>In our opinion, unfounded of course by positive proof, the Apicius
book is somewhat of a gastronomic bible, consisting of ten different
books by several authors, originating in Greece and taken over by the
Romans along with the rest of Greek culture as spoils of war. These
books, or chapters, or fragments thereof, must have been in vogue long
before they were collected and assembled in the present form.
Editions, or copies of the same must have been numerous, either singly
or collectively, at the beginning of our era. As a matter of fact, the
Excerpts by Vinidarius, found in the <em>codex Salmasianus</em> prove this
theory and give rise to the assumption that the Apicius book was a
standard work for cookery that existed at one time or other in a far
more copious volume and that the present Apicius is but a fragment of
a formerly vaster and more complete collection of culinary and medical
formulæ.</p>
<p>Thus a fragmentary Apicius has been handed down to us in manuscript
form through the centuries, through the revolutionary era of Christian
ascendancy, through the dark ages down to the Renaissance. Unknown
agencies, mostly medical and monastic, stout custodians of antique
learning, reverent lovers of good cheer have preserved it for us until
printing made possible the book&#39;s wide distribution among the
scholars. Just prior to Gutenberg&#39;s epoch-making printing press there
was a spurt of interest in our book in Italy, as attested to by a
dozen of manuscripts, copied in the fourteenth and the fifteenth
centuries.</p>
<p>Apicius may justly be called the world&#39;s oldest cookery book; the very
old Sanscrit book, Vasavarayeyam, unknown to us except by name, is
said to be a tract on vegetarian cookery.</p>
<p>The men who have preserved this work for future generations, who have
made it accessible to the public (as was Lister&#39;s intention) have
performed a service to civilization that is not to be underestimated.
They have done better than the average archaeologist with one or
another find to his credit. The Apicius book is a living thing,
capable of creating happiness. Some gastronomic writers have pointed
out that the man who discovers a new dish does more for humanity than
the man who discovers a new star, because the discovery of a new dish
affects the happiness of mankind more pleasantly than the addition of
a new planet to an already overcrowded chart of the universe. Viewing
Apicius from such a materialistic point of view he should become very
popular in this age of ours so keen for utilities of every sort.</p>
<p>CŒLIUS-CÆLIUS</p>
<p>The name of another personality is introduced in connection with the
book, namely that of Cœlius or Cælius. This name is mentioned in
the title of the first undated edition (ca. 1483-6) as Celius.
Torinus, 1541, places &quot;Cælius&quot; before &quot;Apicius&quot;; Humelbergius, 1542,
places &quot;Cœlius&quot; after A. Lister approves of this, berating Torinus
for his willful methods of editing the book: &quot;<em>En hominem in
conjecturis sane audacissimus!</em>&quot; If any of them were correct about
&quot;Cœlius,&quot; Torinus would be the man. (Cf. Schanz, Röm. Lit. Gesch.,
Müller&#39;s Handbuch d. klass. Altertums-Wissenschaft, V III, 112, p.
506.) However, there is no <em>raison d&#39;être</em> for Cœlius.</p>
<p>His presence and the unreality thereof has been cleared up by Vollmer,
as will be duly shown. The squabble of the medieval savants has also
given rise to the story that Apicius is but a joke perpetrated upon
the world by a medieval savant. This will be refuted also later on.
Our book is a genuine Roman. Medieval savants have made plenty of
Roman &quot;fakes,&quot; for sundry reasons. A most ingenious hoax was the
&quot;completion&quot; of the Petronius fragment by a scholar able to hoodwink
his learned contemporaries by an exhibition of Petronian literary
style and a fertile imagination. Ever so many other &quot;fakers&quot; were
shown up in due time. When this version of Petronius was pronounced
genuine by the scientific world, the perpetrator of the &quot;joke&quot;
confessed, enjoying a good laugh at the expense of his colleagues. But
we shall presently understand how such a &quot;joke&quot; with Apicius would be
impossible. Meanwhile, we crave the indulgence of the modern reader
with our mention of Cœlius. We desire to do full justice to the
ancient work and complete the presentation of its history. The
controversies that have raged over it make this course necessary.</p>
<p>Our predecessors have not had the benefit of modern communication,
and, therefore, could not know all that is to be known on the subject.
We sympathize with Lister yet do not condemn Torinus. If Torinus ever
dared making important changes in the old text, they are easily
ascertained by collation with other texts. This we have endeavored to
do. Explaining the discrepancies, it will be noted that we have not
given a full vote of confidence to Lister.</p>
<p>Why should the mysterious Cœlius or Cælius, if such an author or
compiler of a tome on cookery existed affix the name of &quot;Apicius&quot; to
it? The reason would be commercial gain, prestige accruing from the
name of that cookery celebrity. Such business sense would not be
extraordinary. Modern cooks pursue the same method. Witness the
innumerable à la soandsos. Babies, apartment houses, streets, cities,
parks, dogs, race horses, soap, cheese, herring, cigars, hair
restorers are thus named today. &quot;Apicius&quot; on the front page of any
ancient cookery book would be perfectly consistent with the ancient
spirit of advertising. It has been stated, too, that Cœlius had
more than one collaborator. Neither can this be proven.</p>
<p>The copyists have made many changes throughout the original text.
Misspelling of terms, ignorance of cookery have done much to obscure
the meaning. The scribes of the middle ages had much difficulty in
this respect since medieval Latin is different from Apician language.</p>
<p>The very language of the original is proof for its authenticity. The
desire of Torinus to interpret to his medieval readers the ancient
text is pardonable. How much or how little he succeeded is attested to
by some of his contemporary readers, former owners of our copies.
Scholars plainly confess inability to decipher Apicius by groans
inscribed on the fly leaves and title pages in Latin, French and other
languages. One French scholar of the 16th century, apparently &quot;kidded&quot;
for studying an undecipherable cook book, stoically inscribes the
title page of our Lyon, 1541, copy with: &quot;This amuses me. Why make fun
of me?&quot; This sort of message, reaching us out of the dim past of
bygone centuries is among the most touching reading we have done, and
has urged us on with the good though laborious and unprofitable work.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding its drawbacks, our book is a classic both as to form
and contents. It has served as a prototype of most ancient and modern
books. Its influence is felt to the present day.</p>
<p>The book has often been cited by old writers as proof of the
debaucheries and the gluttony of ancient Rome. Nothing could be
further from the truth because these writers failed to understand the
book.</p>
<p>The Apicius book reflects the true condition (partly so, because it is
incomplete) of the kitchen prevailing at the beginning of our era when
the mistress of the Old World was in her full regalia, when her ample
body had not yet succumbed to that fatty degeneration of the interior
so fatal to ever so many individuals, families, cities and nations.</p>
<p>We repeat, our Apicius covers Rome&#39;s healthy epoch; hence the
importance of the book. The voluptuous concoctions, the fabulous
dishes, the proverbial excesses that have made decent people shudder
with disgust throughout the ages are not known to Apicius. If they
ever existed at all in their traditional ugliness they made their
appearance after Apicius&#39; time. We recall, Petronius, describing some
of these &quot;stunts&quot; is a contemporary of Nero (whom he satirizes as
&quot;Trimalchio&quot;). So is Seneca, noble soul, another victim of Cæsarean
insanity; he, too, describes Imperial excesses. These extremely few
foolish creations are really at the bottom of the cause for this
misunderstanding of true Roman life. Such stupidity has allowed the
joy of life which, as Epikuros and Platina believe, may be indulged in
with perfect virtue and honesty to become a byword among all good
people who are not gastronomers either by birth, by choice or by
training.</p>
<p>With due justice to the Roman people may we be permitted to say that
proverbial excesses were exceedingly rare occurrences. The follies and
the vices of a Nero, a boy Heliogabalus, a Pollio, a Vitellius and a
few other notorious wasters are spread sporadically over a period of
at least eight hundred years. Between these cases of gastronomic
insanity lie wellnigh a thousand years of everyday grind and drudgery
of the Roman people. The bulk was miserably fed as compared with
modern standards of living. Only a few patricians could afford &quot;high
living.&quot; Since a prosperous bourgeoisie (usually the economic and
gastronomic background of any nation) was practically unknown in Rome,
where the so-called middle classes were in reality poor, shiftless and
floating freedmen, it is evident that the bulk of the population
because of the empire&#39;s unsettled economic conditions, its extensive
system of slavery (precluding all successful practice of trades by
freemen), the continuous military operations, the haphazard financial
system, was forced to live niggardly. The contrast between the middle
classes and the upper classes seemed very cruel. This condition may
account for the many outcries against the &quot;extravagances&quot; of the few
privileged ones who could afford decent food and for the exaggerated
stories about their table found in the literature of the time.</p>
<p>The seemingly outlandish methods of Apician food preparation become
plain and clear in the light of social evolution. &quot;Evolution&quot; is
perhaps not the right word to convey our idea of social perpetual
motion.</p>
<p>Apicius used practically all the cooking utensils in use today. He
only lacked gas, electricity and artificial refrigeration, modern
achievements while useful in the kitchen and indispensable in
wholesale production and for labor saving, that have no bearing on
purely gastronomical problems. There is only one difference between
the cooking utensils of yore and the modern products: the old ones are
hand-made, more individualistic, more beautiful, more artistic than
our machine-made varieties.</p>
<p>Despite his strangeness and remoteness, Apicius is not dead by any
means. We have but to inspect (as Gollmer has pointed out) the table
of the Southern Europeans to find Apician traditions alive. In the
Northern countries, too, are found his traces. To think that Apicius
should have survived in the North of Europe, far removed from his
native soil, is a rather audacious suggestion. But the keen observer
can find him in Great Britain, Scandinavia and the Baltic provinces
today. The conquerors and seafarers coming from the South have carried
the pollen of gastronomic flowers far into the North where they
adjusted themselves to soil and climate. Many a cook of the British
isles, of Southern Sweden, Holstein, Denmark, Friesland, Pomerania
still observes Apicius rules though he may not be aware of the fact.</p>
<p>We must realize that Apicius is only a book, a frail hand-made record
and that, while the record itself might have been forgotten, its
principles have become international property, long ago. Thus they
live on. Like a living thing—a language, a custom, they themselves
may have undergone changes, &quot;improvements,&quot; alterations, augmentation,
corruption. But the character has been preserved; a couple of thousand
years are, after all, but a paltry matter. Our own age is but the
grandchild of antiquity. The words we utter, in their roots, are those
of our grandfathers. And so do many dishes we eat today resemble those
once enjoyed by Apicius and his friends.</p>
<p>Is it necessary to point the tenacity of the spirit of the Antique,
reaching deep into the modern age? The latest Apicius edition in the
original Latin is dated 1922!</p>
<p>The gastronomic life of Europe was under the complete rule of old Rome
until the middle of the seventeenth century. Then came a sudden change
for modernity, comparable to the rather abrupt change of languages
from the fashionable Latin to the national idioms and vernacular, in
England and Germany under the influence of literary giants like
Luther, Chaucer, Shakespeare.</p>
<p>All medieval food literature of the continent and indeed the early
cookery books of England prior to La Varenne (Le Cuisinier François,
1654) are deeply influenced by Apicius. The great change in eating,
resulting in a new gastronomic order, attained its highest peak of
perfection just prior to the French revolution. Temporarily suspended
by this social upheaval, it continued to flourish until about the
latter part of last century. The last decades of this new order is
often referred to as the classical period of gastronomy, with France
claiming the laurels for its development. &quot;Classic&quot; for reasons we do
not know (Urbain Dubois, outstanding master of this period wrote &quot;La
Cuisine classique&quot;) except that its precepts appeal as classical to
our notion of eating. This may not correspond to the views of
posterity, we had therefore better wait a century or two before
proclaiming our system of cookery &quot;classical.&quot;</p>
<p>Disposing of that old &quot;classic,&quot; Apicius, as slowly as a conservative
cooking world could afford to do, the present nations set out to
cultivate a taste for things that a Roman would have pronounced unfit
for a slave. Still, the world moves on. Conquest, discovery of foreign
parts, the New World, contributed fine things to the modern
table,—old forgotten foods were rediscovered—endless lists of
materials and combinations, new daring, preposterous dishes that made
the younger generation rejoice while old folks looked on gasping with
dismay, despair, contempt.</p>
<p>Be it sufficient to remark that the older practitioners of our own
days, educated in &quot;classic&quot; cuisine again are quite apprehensive of
their traditions endangered by the spirit of revolt of the young
against the old. Again and again we hear of a decline that has set in,
and even by the best authorities alarmist notes are spread to the
effect that &quot;we have begun our journey back, step by step to our
primitive tree and our primitive nuts&quot; (Pennell. Does Spengler
consider food in his &quot;Decline of the West?&quot;).</p>
<p>It matters not whether we share this pessimism, nor what we may have
to say <em>pro</em> or <em>con</em> this question of &quot;progress&quot; or &quot;retrogression&quot;
in eating (or in anything else for that matter). In fact we are not
concerned with the question here more than to give it passing
attention.</p>
<p>If &quot;classic&quot; cookery is dying nowadays, if it cannot reassert itself
that would be a loss to mankind. But this classic cookery system has
so far only been the sole and exclusive privilege of a dying
aristocracy. It seems quite in order that it should go under in the
great <em>Götterdämmerung</em> that commenced with the German peasants wars
of the sixteenth century, flaring up (as the second act) in the French
revolution late in the eighteenth century, the Act III of which drama
has been experienced in our own days.</p>
<p>The common people as yet have never had an active part in the
enjoyment of the classic art of eating. So far, they always provided
the wherewithal, and looked on, holding the bag. Modern hotels,
because of their commercial character, have done little to perpetuate
it. They merely have commercialized the art. Beyond exercising
ordinary salesmanship, our <em>maîtres d&#39;hôtel</em> have not educated our
<em>nouveaux riches</em> in the mysteries and delights of gastronomy.
Hotelmen are not supposed to be educators, they merely cater to a
demand. And our new aristocracy has been too busy with limousines,
golf, divorces and electricity to bemourn the decline of classic
cookery.</p>
<p>Most people &quot;get by&quot; without the benefit of classic cookery,
subsisting on a medley of edibles, tenaciously clinging to mother&#39;s
traditions, to things &quot;as she used to make them,&quot; and mother&#39;s methods
still savor of Apicius. Surely, this is no sign of retrogression but
of tenacity.</p>
<p>The only fundamental difference between Roman dining and that of our
own times may be found in these two indisputable facts—</p>
<p>(First) Devoid of the science of agriculture, without any advanced
mechanical means, food was not raised in a very systematic way; if it
happened to be abundant, Roma lacked storage and transportation
facilities to make good use of it. There never were any food supplies
on any large, extensive and scientific scale, hence raw materials, the
wherewithal of a &quot;classic&quot; meal, were expensive.</p>
<p>(Second) Skilled labor, so vital for the success of any good dinner,
so imperative for the rational preparation of food was cheap to those
who held slaves.</p>
<p>Hence, the culinary conditions of ancient Rome were exactly the
opposite of today&#39;s state of affairs. Then, good food was expensive
while good labor was cheap. Now, good food is cheap while skilled
labor is at a premium. Somehow, good, intelligent &quot;labor&quot; is reluctant
to devote itself to food. That is another story. The chances for a
good dinner seemed to be in favor of the Romans—but only for a
favored few. Those of us, although unable to command a staff of
experts, but able to prepare their own meals rationally and serve them
well are indeed fortunate. With a few dimes they may dine in royal
fashion. If our much maligned age has achieved anything at all it has
at least enabled the working &quot;slave&quot; of the &quot;masses&quot; to dine in a
manner that even princes could hardly match in former days, a manner
indeed that the princes of our own time could not improve upon. The
fly in the ointment is that most modern people do not know how to
handle and to appreciate food. This condition, however, may be
remedied by instruction and education.</p>
<p>Slowly, the modern masses are learning to emulate their erstwhile
masters in the art of eating. They have the advantages of the great
improvements in provisioning as compared with former days, thanks
chiefly to the great lines of communication established by modern
commerce, thanks to scientific agriculture and to the spirit of
commercial enterprise and its resulting prosperity.</p>
<p>There are two &quot;Ifs&quot; in the path to humanity&#39;s salvation, at least,
that of its table. If the commercialization of cookery, i.e., the
wholesale production of ready-made foods for the table does not
completely enthrall the housewife and if we can succeed to educate the
masses to make rational, craftsmanlike use of our wonderful stores of
edibles, employing or modifying to this end the rules of classic
cookery, there really should be no need for any serious talk about our
journey back to the primitive nuts. Even Spengler might be wrong then.
Adequate distribution of our foods and rational use thereof seem to be
one of the greatest problems today.</p>
<p>THE AUTHENTICITY OF APICIUS</p>
<p>Age-old mysteries surrounding our book have not yet been cleared up.
Medieval savants have squabbled in vain. Mrs. Pennell&#39;s worries and
the fears of the learned Englishmen that Apicius might be a hoax have
proven groundless. Still, the mystery of this remarkable book is as
perplexing as ever. The authorship will perhaps never be established.
But let us forever dispel any doubt about its authenticity.</p>
<p>Modern writers have never doubted the genuineness. To name but a few
who believe in Apicius: Thudichum, Vollmer, Brandt, Vicaire, Rumohr,
Schuch, Habs, Gollmer.</p>
<p>What matters the identity of the author? Who wrote the Iliad, the
Odyssey, the Nibelungen-Lied? Let us be thankful for possessing them!</p>
<p>Apicius is a genuine document of Roman imperial days. There can be no
doubt of that!</p>
<p>The unquestionable age of the earliest known manuscripts alone
suffices to prove this.</p>
<p>The philologist gives his testimony, too. A medieval scholar could
never have manufactured Apicius, imitating his strikingly original
terminology. &quot;Faking&quot; a technical treatise requires an intimate
knowledge of technical terms and familiarity with the ramifications of
an intricate trade. We recommend a comparison of Platina&#39;s text with
Apicius: the difference of ancient and medieval Latin is convincing.
Striking examples of this kind have been especially noted in our
dictionary of technical terms.</p>
<p>LATIN SLANG</p>
<p>H. C. Coote, in his commentary on Apicius (cit. Apiciana) in speaking
of pan gravy, remarks:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Apicius calls this by the singular phrase of _jus de
suo sibi_! and sometimes though far less frequently,
_succus suus_. This phrase is curious enough in itself
to deserve illustration. It is true old fashioned
Plautian Latinity, and if other proof were wanting would
of itself demonstrate the genuineness of the Apician
text.&quot;</code></pre><p>This scholar goes on quoting from Plautus, <em>Captivi</em>, Act I, sc. 2,
vv. 12, 13; <em>Amphitruo</em>, Act I, sc. q.v. 116 and <em>ibid.</em> v. 174; and
from <em>Asinaria</em>, Act IV, sc. 2, vv. 16 and 17 to prove this, and he
further says:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;The phrase is a rare remnant of the old familiar
language of Rome, such as slaves talked so long, that
their masters ultimately adopted it—a language of which
Plautus gives us glimpses and which the _graffiti_ may
perhaps help to restore. When Varius was emperor, this
phrase of the kitchen was as rife as when Plautus
wrote—a proof that occasionally slang has been long
lived.&quot;</code></pre><p>Coote is a very able commentator. He has translated in the article
quoted a number of Apician formulæ; and betrays an unusual culinary
knowledge.</p>
<h4 id="modern-research">MODERN RESEARCH</h4>
<p>Modern means of communication and photography have enabled scientists
in widely different parts to study our book from all angles, to
scrutinize the earliest records, the Vatican and the New York
manuscripts and the codex Salmasianus in Paris.</p>
<p>Friedrich Vollmer, of Munich, in his <em>Studien</em> (cit. Apiciana) has
treated the manuscripts exhaustively, carrying to completion the
research begun by Schuch, Traube, Ihm, Studemund, Giarratano and
others with Brandt, his pupil, carrying on the work of Vollmer. More
modern scientists deeply interested in the origin of our book! None
doubting its genuineness.</p>
<p>Vollmer is of the opinion that there reposed in the monastery of
Fulda, Germany, an <em>Archetypus</em> which in the ninth century was copied
twice: once in a Turonian hand—the manuscript now kept in the
Vatican—the other copy written partly in insular, partly in
Carolingian minuscle—the Cheltenham <em>codex</em>, now in New York. The
common source at Fulda of these two manuscripts has been established
by Traube. There is another testimony pointing to Fulda as the oldest
known source. Pope Nicholas V commissioned Enoche of Ascoli to acquire
old manuscripts in Germany. Enoche used as a guide a list of works
based upon observations by Poggio in Germany in 1417, listing the
Apicius of Fulda. Enoche acquired the Fulda Apicius. He died in
October or November, 1457. On December 10th of that year, so we know,
Giovanni de&#39;Medici requested Stefano de&#39;Nardini, Governor of Ancona,
to procure for him from Enoche&#39;s estate either in copy or in the
original the book, entitled, <em>Appicius de re quoquinaria</em> (cf. No. 3,
Apiciana). It is interesting to note that one of the Milanese editions
of 1498 bears a title in this particular spelling. Enoche during his
life time had lent the book to Giovanni Aurispa.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that Poggio, in 1417, viewed at Fulda the
<em>Archetypus</em> of our Apicius, father of the Vatican and the New York
manuscripts, then already mutilated and wanting books IX and X. Six
hundred years before the arrival of Poggio the Fulda book was no
longer complete. Already in the ninth century its title page had been
damaged which is proven by the title page of the Vatican copy which
reads:</p>
<pre><code>    INCP
    API
    CÆ</code></pre><p>That&#39;s all! The New York copy, it has been noted, has no title page.
This book commences in the middle of the list of chapters; the first
part of them and the title page are gone. We recall that the New York
manuscript was originally bound up with another manuscript, also in
the Phillipps library at Cheltenham. The missing page or pages were
probably lost in separating the two manuscripts. It is possible that
Enoche carried with him to Italy one of the ancient copies, very
likely the present New York copy, then already without a title. At any
rate, not more than twenty-five years after his book hunting
expedition we find both copies in Italy. It is strange, furthermore,
that neither of these two ancient copies were used by the fifteenth
century copyists to make the various copies distributed by them, but
that an inferior copy of the Vatican Ms. became the _vulgata_—the
progenitor of this series of medieval copies. One must bear in mind
how assiduously medieval scribes copied everything that appeared to be
of any importance to them, and how each new copy by virtue of human
fallibility or self-sufficiency must have suffered in the making, and
it is only by very careful comparison of the various manuscripts that
the original text may be rehabilitated.</p>
<p>This, to a large extent, Vollmer and Giarratano have accomplished.
Vollmer, too, rejects the idea invented by the humanists, that Apicius
had a collaborator, editor or commentator in the person of Cœlius
or Cælius. This name, so Vollmer claims, has been added to the book by
medieval scholars without any reason except conjecture for such
action. They have been misled by the mutilated title: Api... Cæ...;
Vollmer reconstructs this title as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    API[cii artis magiri- (or) opsartyti-]
    CÆ[libri X]</code></pre><p>Remember, it is the title page only that is thus mutilated. The ten
books or chapters bear the full name of Apicius, never at any time
does the name of Cœlius appear in the text, or at the head of the
chapters.</p>
<p>The <em>Archetypus</em>, with the book and the chapters carefully indexed and
numbered as they were, with each article neatly titled, the captions
and capital letters rubricated—heightened by red color, and with its
proper spacing of the articles and chapters must once have been a
representative example of the art of book making as it flourished
towards the end of the period that sealed the fate of the Roman
empire, when books of a technical nature, law books, almanacs, army
lists had been developed to a high point of perfection. Luxurious
finish, elaborate illumination point to the fact that our book (the
Vatican copy) was intended for the use in some aristocratic household.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="the-excerpts-of-vinidarius">THE EXCERPTS OF VINIDARIUS</h4>
<p>And now, from a source totally different than the two important
manuscripts so much discussed here, we receive additional proof of the
authenticity of Apicius. In the <em>codex Salmasianus</em> (cf. III,
Apiciana) we find some thirty formulæ attributed to Apicius, entitled:
<em>Apici excerpta a Vinidario vir. inl.</em> They have been accepted as
genuine by Salmasius and other early scholars. Schuch incorporated the
<em>excerpta</em> with his Apicius, placing the formulæ in what he believed
to be the proper order. This course, for obvious reasons, is not to be
recommended. To be sure, the <em>excerpta</em> are Apician enough in
character, though only a few correspond to, or are actual duplicates
of, the Apician precepts. They are additions to the stock of authentic
Apician recipes. As such, they may not be included but be appended to
the traditional text. The <em>excerpta</em> encourage the belief that at the
time of Vinidarius (got. Vinithaharjis) about the fifth century there
must have been in circulation an Apicius (collection of recipes) much
more complete than the one handed down to us through Fulda. It is
furthermore interesting to note that the <em>excerpta</em>, too, are silent
about Cœlius.</p>
<p>We may safely join Vollmer in his belief that M. Gabius Apicius,
celebrated gourmet living during the reign of Tiberius was the real
author, or collector, or sponsor of this collection of recipes, or at
least of the major part thereof—the formulæ bearing the names of
posterior gourmets having been added from time to time. This theory
also applies to the two instances where the name of Varro is mentioned
in connection with the preparation of beets and onions (bulbs). It is
hardly possible that the author of the book made these references to
Varro. It is more probable that some well-versed posterior reader,
perusing the said articles, added to his copy: &quot;And Varro prepared
beets this way, and onions that way....&quot; (cf. Book III, [70]) Still,
there is no certainty in this theory either. There were many persons
by the names of Commodus, Trajanus, Frontinianus, such as are
appearing in our text, who were contemporaries of Apicius.</p>
<p>With our mind at ease as regards the genuineness of our book we now
may view it at a closer range.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="obscure-terminology">OBSCURE TERMINOLOGY</h4>
<p>Apicius contains technical terms that have been the subject of much
speculation and discussion. <em>Liquamen</em>, <em>laser</em>, <em>muria</em>, <em>garum</em>,
etc., belong to these. They will be found in our little dictionary.
But we cannot refrain from discussing some at present to make
intelligible the most essential part of the ancient text.</p>
<p>Take <em>liquamen</em> for instance. It may stand for broth, sauce, stock,
gravy, drippings, even for <em>court bouillon_—in fact for any liquid
appertaining to or derived from a certain dish or food material. Now,
if Apicius prescribes _liquamen</em> for the preparation of a meat or a
vegetable, it is by no means clear to the uninitiated what he has in
mind. In fact, in each case the term <em>liquamen</em> is subject to the
interpretation of the experienced practitioner. Others than he would
at once be confronted with an unsurmountable difficulty. Scientists
may not agree with us, but such is kitchen practice. Hence the many
fruitless controversies at the expense of the original, at the
disappointment of science.</p>
<p><em>Garum</em> is another word, one upon which much contemptuous witticism
and serious energy has been spent. <em>Garum</em> simply is a generic name
for fish essences. True, <em>garus</em> is a certain and a distinct kind of
Mediterranean fish, originally used in the manufacture of <em>garum</em>; but
this product, in the course of time, has been altered, modified,
adulterated,—in short, has been changed and the term has naturally
been applied to all varieties and variations of fish essences, without
distinction, and it has thus become a collective term, covering all
varieties of fish sauces. Indeed, the corruption and degeneration of
this term, <em>garum</em>, had so advanced at the time of Vinidarius in the
fifth century as to lose even its association with any kind of fish.
Terms like <em>garatum</em> (prepared with g.) have been derived from it.
Prepared with the addition of wine it becomes <em>œnogarum</em>,—wine
sauce—and dishes prepared with such wine sauce receive the adjective
of <em>œnogaratum</em>, and so forth.</p>
<p>The original <em>garum</em> was no doubt akin to our modern anchovy sauce, at
least the best quality of the ancient sauce. The principles of
manufacture surely are alike. <em>Garum</em>, like our anchovy sauce, is the
<em>purée</em> of a small fish, named <em>garus</em>, as yet unidentified. The fish,
intestines and all, was spiced, pounded, fermented, salted, strained
and bottled for future use. The finest <em>garum</em> was made of the livers
of the fish only, exposed to the sun, fermented, somehow preserved. It
was an expensive article in old Rome, famed for its medicinal
properties. Its mode of manufacture has given rise to much criticism
and scorn on the part of medieval and modern commentators and
interpreters who could not comprehend the &quot;perverse taste&quot; of the
ancients in placing any value on the &quot;essence from putrified
intestines of fish.&quot;</p>
<p>However, <em>garum</em> has been vindicated, confirmed, endorsed, reiterated,
rediscovered, if you please, by modern science! What, pray, is the
difference in principle between <em>garum</em> (the exact nature of which is
unknown) and the oil of the liver of cod (or less expensive fish)
exposed to the beneficial rays of ultraviolet light—artificial
sunlight—to imbue the oil with an extra large and uniform dose of
vitamin D? The ancients, it appears, knew &quot;vitamin D&quot; to exist. Maybe
they had a different name for &quot;vitamins,&quot; maybe none at all. The name
does not matter. The thing which they knew, does. They knew the
nutritive value of liver, proven by many formulæ. Pollio, one of the
vicious characters of antiquity, fed murenas (sea-eel) with slaves he
threw into the <em>piscina</em>, the fish pond, and later enjoyed the liver
of the fish.</p>
<p>Some &quot;modern&quot; preparations are astonishingly ancient, and <em>vice
versa</em>. Our anchovy sauce is used freely to season fish, to mix with
butter, to be made into solid anchovy or fish paste. There are sardine
pastes, lobster pastes, fish forcemeats found in the larder of every
good kitchen—preparations of Apician character. A real platter of
<em>hors d&#39;oeuvres</em>, an <em>antipasto</em> is not complete unless made according
to certain Apician precepts.</p>
<p><em>Muria</em> is salt water, brine, yet it may stand for a fluid in which
fish or meat, fruits or vegetables have been pickled.</p>
<p>The difficulties of the translator of Apicius who takes him literally,
are unconsciously but neatly demonstrated by the work of Danneil. Even
he, seasoned practitioner, condemns <em>garum</em>, <em>muria</em>, <em>asa
fœtida</em>, because professors before him have done so, because he
forgets that these very materials still form a vital part of some of
his own sauces only in a different shape, form or under a different
name. Danneil calls some Apician recipes &quot;incredibly absurd,&quot;
&quot;fabulous,&quot; &quot;exaggerated,&quot; but he thinks nothing of the serving of
similar combinations in his own establishment every day in the year.</p>
<p>Danneil would take pride in serving a Veal Cutlet à la Holstein. (What
have we learned of Apicius in the Northern countries?). The ancient
Holsteiner was not satisfied unless his piece of veal was covered with
a nice fat herring. That &quot;barbarity&quot; had to be modified by us moderns
into a veal cutlet, turned in milk and flour, eggs and bread crumbs,
fried, covered with fried eggs, garnished with anchovies or bits of
herring, red beets, capers, and lemon in order to qualify for a
restaurant favorite and &quot;best seller.&quot; Apicius hardly has a dish more
characteristic and more bewildering.</p>
<p>What of combinations of fish and meat?</p>
<p><em>De gustibus non est disputandum.</em> It all goes into the same stomach.
May it be a sturdy one, and let its owner beware. What of our turkey
and oyster dressing? Of our broiled fish and bacon? Of our clam
chowder, our divine <em>Bouillabaisse</em>? If the ingredients and component
parts of such dishes were enumerated in the laconic and careless
Apician style, if they were stated without explicit instructions and
details (supposed to be known to any good practitioner) we would have
recipes just as mysterious as any of the Apician formulæ.</p>
<p>Danneil, like ever so many interpreters, plainly shared the
traditional belief, the egregious errors of popular history. People
still are under the spell of the fantastic and fanciful descriptions
of Roman conviviality and gastronomic eccentricities. Indeed, we
rather believe in the insanity of these descriptions than in the
insane conduct of the average Roman gourmet. It is absurd of course to
assume and to make the world believe that a Roman patrician made a
meal of <em>garum</em>, <em>laserpitium</em>, and the like. They used these
condiments judiciously; any other use thereof is physically
impossible. They economized their spices which have caused so much
comment, too. As a matter of fact, they used condiments niggardly and
sparingly as is plainly described in some formulæ, if only for the one
good and sufficient reason that spices and condiments which often came
from Asia and Africa were extremely expensive. This very reason,
perhaps, caused much of the popular outcry against their use, which,
by the way, is merely another form of political propaganda, in which,
as we shall see, the mob guided by the rabble of politicians excelled.</p>
<p>We moderns are just as &quot;extravagant&quot; (if not more) in the use of
sauces and condiments—Apician sauces, too! Our Worcestershire,
catsup, chili, chutney, walnut catsup, A I, Harvey&#39;s, Punch, Soyer&#39;s,
Escoffier&#39;s, Oscar&#39;s (every culinary coryphee endeavors to create
one)—our mustards and condiments in their different forms, if not
actually dating back to Apicius, are, at least lineal descendants from
ancient prototypes.</p>
<p>To readers little experienced in kitchen practice such phrases (often
repeated by Apicius) as, &quot;crush pepper, lovage, marjoram,&quot; etc.,
etc., may appear stereotyped and monotonous. They have not survived in
modern kitchen parlance, because the practice of using spices, flavors
and aromas has changed. There are now in the market compounds,
extracts, mixtures not used in the old days. Many modern spices come
to us ready ground or mixed, or compounded ready for kitchen use. This
has the disadvantage in that volatile properties deteriorate more
rapidly and that the goods may be easily adulterated. The Bavarians,
under Duke Albrecht, in 1553 prohibited the grinding of spices for
that very reason! Ground spices are time and labor savers, however.
Modern kitchen methods have put the old mortar practically out of
existence, at the expense of quality of the finished product.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="the-labor-item">THE &quot;LABOR ITEM&quot;</h4>
<p>The enviable Apicius cared naught for either time or labor. He gave
these two important factors in modern life not a single thought. His
culinary procedures required a prodigious amount of labor and effort
on the part of the cooks and their helpers. The labor item never
worried any ancient employer. It was either very cheap or entirely
free of charge.</p>
<p>The selfish gourmet (which gourmet is not selfish?) almost wonders
whether the abolition of slavery was a well-advised measure in modern
social and economic life. Few people appreciate the labor cost in
excellent cookery and few have any conception of the cost of good food
service today. Yet all demand both, when &quot;dining out,&quot; at least. Who,
on the other hand, but a brute would care to dine well, &quot;taking it out
of the hide of others?&quot;</p>
<p>Hence we moderns with a craving for <em>gourmandise</em> but minus
appropriations for skilled labor would do well to follow the example
of Alexandre Dumas who cheerfully and successfully attended to his own
cuisine. Despite an extensive fiction practice he found time to edit
&quot;Le Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine&quot; and was not above writing mustard
advertisements, either.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="sumptuary-laws">SUMPTUARY LAWS</h4>
<p>The appetite of the ancients was at times successfully curbed by
sumptuary laws, cropping out at fairly regular intervals. These laws,
usually given under the pretext of safeguarding the morals of the
people and accompanied by similar euphonious phrases were, like modern
prohibitions, vicious and virulent effusions of the predatory instinct
in mankind. We cannot give a chronological list of them here, and are
citing them merely to illustrate the difficulty confronting the
prospective ancient host.</p>
<p>During the reign of Cæsar and Augustus severe laws were passed, fixing
the sums to be spent for public and private dinners and specifying the
edibles to be consumed. These laws classified gastronomic functions
with an ingenious eye for system, professing all the time to protect
the public&#39;s morals and health; but they were primarily designed to
replenish the ever-vanishing contents of the Imperial exchequer and
to provide soft jobs for hordes of enforcers. The amounts allowed to
be spent for various social functions were so ridiculously small in
our own modern estimation that we may well wonder how a Roman host
could have ever made a decent showing at a banquet. However, he and
the cooks managed somehow. Imperial spies and informers were
omnipresent. The market places were policed, the purchases by
prospective hosts carefully noted, dealers selling supplies and cooks
(the more skillful kind usually) hired for the occasion were bribed to
reveal the &quot;menu.&quot; Dining room windows had to be located conveniently
to allow free inspection from the street of the dainties served; the
passing Imperial food inspector did not like to intrude upon the
sanctity of the host&#39;s home. The pitiable host of those days, his
unenviable guests and the bewildered cooks, however, contrived and
conspired somehow to get up a banquet that was a trifle better than a
Chicago quick lunch.</p>
<p>How did they do it?</p>
<p>In the light of modern experience gained by modern governments
dillydallying with sumptuary legislation that has been discarded as a
bad job some two thousand years ago, the question seems superfluous.</p>
<p><em>Difficile est satyram non scribere!</em> To make a long story short: The
Roman host just broke the law, that&#39;s all. Indeed, those who made the
laws were first to break them. The minions, appointed to uphold the
law, were easily accounted for. Any food inspector too arduous in the
pursuit of his duty was disposed of by dispatching him to the rear
entrance of the festive hall, and was delivered to the tender care of
the chief cook.</p>
<p>Such was the case during the times of Apicius. Indeed, the Roman idea
of good cheer during earlier epochs was provincial enough. It was
simply barbaric before the Greeks showed the Romans a thing or two in
cookery. The methods of fattening fowl introduced from Greece was
something unheard-of! It was outrageous, sacrilegious! Senators,
orators and other self-appointed saviors of humanity thundered against
the vile methods of tickling the human palate, deftly employing all
the picturesque tam-tam and <em>élan</em> still the stock in trade of ever so
many modern colleagues in any civilized parliament. The speeches, to
be sure, passed into oblivion, the fat capons, however, stayed in the
barnyards until they had acquired the saturation point of tender
luscious calories to be enjoyed by those who could afford them. How
the capon was &quot;invented&quot; is told in a note on the subject.</p>
<p>Many other so-called luxuries, sausage from Epirus, cherries from the
Pontus, oysters from England, were greeted with a studied hostility by
those who profited from the business of making laws and public
opinion.</p>
<p>Evidently, the time and the place was not very propitious for
gastronomic over-indulgence. Only when the ice was broken, when the
disregard for law and order had become general through the continuous
practice of contempt for an unpopular sumptuary law, when corruption
had become wellnigh universal chiefly thanks to the examples set by
the higher-ups, it was then that the torrent of human passion and
folly ran riot, exceeding natural bounds, tearing everything with
them, all that is beautiful and decent, thus swamping the great empire
beyond the hopes for any recovery.</p>
<h4 id="apicius-the-writer">APICIUS THE WRITER</h4>
<p>Most of the Apician directions are vague, hastily jotted down,
carelessly edited. One of the chief reasons for the eternal
misunderstandings! Often the author fails to state the quantities to
be used. He has a mania for giving undue prominence to expensive
spices and other (quite often irrelevant) ingredients. Plainly,
Apicius was no writer, no editor. He was a cook. He took it for
granted that spices be used within the bounds of reason, but he could
not afford to forget them in his formulæ.</p>
<p>Apicius surely pursues the correct culinary principle of incorporating
the flavoring agents during the process of cooking, contrary to many
moderns who, vigorously protesting against &quot;highly seasoned&quot; and
&quot;rich&quot; food, and who, craving for &quot;something plain&quot; proceed to
inundate perfectly good, plain roast or boiled dishes with a deluge of
any of the afore-mentioned commercial &quot;sauces&quot; that have absolutely no
relation to the dish and that have no mission other than to grant
relief from the deadening monotony of &quot;plain&quot; food. Chicken or mutton,
beef or venison, finnan haddie or brook trout, eggs or oysters thus
&quot;sauced,&quot; taste all alike—sauce! To use such ready-made sauces with
dishes cooked <em>à l&#39;anglaise</em> is logical, excusable, almost advisable.
Even the most ascetic of men cannot resist the insidiousness of spicy
delights, nor can he for any length of time endure the insipidity of
plain food sans sauce. Hence the popularity of such sauces amongst
people who do not observe the correct culinary principle of seasoning
food judiciously, befitting its character, without spoiling but rather
in enhancing its characteristics and in bringing out its flavor at the
right time, namely during coction to give the kindred aromas a chance
to blend well.</p>
<p>Continental nations, adhering to this important principle of cookery
(inherited from Apicius) would not dream of using ready-made (English)
sauces.</p>
<p>We have witnessed real crimes being perpetrated upon perfectly
seasoned and delicately flavored <em>entrées</em>. We have watched
ill-advised people maltreat good things, cooked to perfection, even
before they tasted them, sprinkling them as a matter of habit, with
quantities of salt and pepper, paprika, cayenne, daubing them with
mustards of every variety or swamping them with one or several of the
commercial sauce preparations. &quot;Temperamental&quot; chefs, men who know
their art, usually explode at the sight of such wantonness. Which
painter would care to see his canvas varnished with all the hues in
the rainbow by a patron afflicted with such a taste?</p>
<p>Perhaps the craving for excessive flavoring is an olfactory delirium,
a pathological case, as yet unfathomed like the excessive craving for
liquor, and, being a problem for the medical fraternity, it is only of
secondary importance to gastronomy.</p>
<p>To say that the Romans were afflicted on a national scale with a
strange spice mania (as some interpreters want us to believe) would be
equivalent to the assertion that all wine-growing nations were nations
of drunkards. As a matter of fact, the reverse is the truth.</p>
<p>Apicius surely would be surprised at some things we enjoy. <em>Voilà</em>, a
recipe, &quot;modern,&quot; not older than half a century, given by us in the
Apician style or writing: Take liquamen, pepper, cayenne, eggs, lemon,
olive oil, vinegar, white wine, anchovies, onions, tarragon, pickled
cucumbers, parsley, chervil, hard-boiled eggs, capers, green peppers,
mustard, chop, mix well, and serve.</p>
<p>Do you recognize it? This formula sounds as phantastic, as &quot;weird&quot; and
as &quot;vile&quot; as any of the Apician concoctions, confusing even a
well-trained cook because we stated neither the title of this
preparation nor the mode of making it, nor did we name the ingredients
in their proper sequence. This mystery was conceived with an
illustrative purpose which will be explained later, which may and may
not have to do with the mystery of Apicius. Consider, for a moment,
this mysterious creation No. 2: Take bananas, oranges, cherries,
flavored with bitter almonds, fresh pineapple, lettuce, fresh peaches,
plums, figs, grapes, apples, nuts, cream cheese, olive oil, eggs,
white wine, vinegar, cayenne, lemon, salt, white pepper, dry mustard,
tarragon, rich sour cream, chop, mix, whip well.</p>
<p>Worse yet! Instead of having our appetite aroused the very perusal of
this quasi-Apician <em>mixtum compositum</em> repels every desire to partake
of it. We are justly tempted to condemn it as being utterly
impossible. Yet every day hundreds of thousand portions of it are sold
under the name of special fruit salad with <em>mayonnaise mousseuse</em>. The
above mystery No. 1 is the justly popular tartar sauce.</p>
<p>Thus we could go on analyzing modern preparations and make them appear
as outlandish things. Yet we relish them every day. The ingredients,
obnoxious in great quantities, are employed with common sense. We are
not mystified seeing them in print; they are usually given in clear
logical order. This is not the style of Apicius, however.</p>
<h4 id="latin-cunning">LATIN CUNNING</h4>
<p>We can hardly judge Apicius by what he has revealed but we rather
should try to discover what he—purposely or otherwise—has concealed
if we would get a good idea of the ancient kitchen. This thought
occurred to us at the eleventh hour, after years of study of the text
and after almost despairing of a plausible solution of its mysteries.
And it seems surprising that Apicius has never been suspected before
of withholding information essential to the successful practice of his
rather hypothetical and empirical formulæ. The more we scrutinize
them, the more we become convinced that the author has omitted vital
directions—same as we did purposely with the two modern examples
above. Many of the Apician recipes are dry enumerations of ingredients
supposed to belong to a given dish or sauce. It is well-known that in
chemistry (cookery is but applied chemistry) the knowledge of the
rules governing the quantities and the sequence of the ingredients,
their manipulation, either separately or jointly, either successively
or simultaneously, is a very important matter, and that violation or
ignorance of the process may spell failure at any stage of the
experiment. In the kitchen this is particularly true of baking and
soup and sauce making, the most intricate of culinary operations.</p>
<p>There may have been two chief reasons for concealing necessary
information. Apicius, or more likely the professional collectors of
the recipes, may have considered technical elaboration of the formulæ
quite superfluous on the assumption that the formulæ were for
professional use only. Every good practitioner knows, with ingredients
or components given, what manipulations are required, what effects are
desired. Even in the absence of detailed specifications, the
experienced practitioner will be able to divine correct proportions,
by intuition. As a matter of fact, in cookery the mention in the right
place of a single ingredient, like in poetry the right word, often
suffices to conjure up before the gourmet&#39;s mental eye vistas of
delight. Call it inspiration, association of ideas or what you please,
a single word may often prove a guide, a savior.</p>
<p>Let us remember that in Apicii days paper (parchment, papyrus) and
writing materials were expensive and that, moreover, the ability of
correct logical and literary expression was necessarily limited in the
case of a practising cook who, after all, must have been the collector
of the Apician formulæ. This is sufficiently proven by the <em>lingua
coquinaria</em>, the vulgar Latin of our old work. In our opinion, the
ancient author did not consider it worth his while to give anything
but the most indispensable information in the tersest form. This he
certainly did. A comparison of his literary performance with that of
the artistic and accomplished writer of the Renaissance, Platina, will
at once show up Apicius as a hard-working practical cook, a man who
knew his business but who could not tell what he knew.</p>
<p>Like ever so many of his successors, he could not refrain from
beginning and concluding many of his articles with such superfluities
as &quot;take this&quot; and &quot;And serve,&quot; etc., all of which shows him up as a
genuine cook. These articles, written in the most laconic language
possible—the language of a very busy, very harassed, very hurried
man, are the literary product of a cook, or several of them.</p>
<p>The other chief motive for condensing or obscuring his text has a more
subtle foundation. Indeed, we are surprised that we should possess so
great a collection of recipes, representing to him who could use them
certain commercial and social value. The preservation of Apicius seems
entirely accidental. Experienced cooks were in demand in Apicii times;
the valuation of their ministrations increased proportionately to the
progress in gastronomy and to the prosperity of the nation. During
Rome&#39;s frugal era, up to 200 B.C. the primitive cooks were just slaves
and household chattels; but the development of their trade into an
art, stimulated by foreign precepts, imported principally from Greece,
Sicily and Asia Minor, opened up to the practitioners not only the
door to freedom from servitude but it offered even positions of wealth
with social and political standing, often arousing the envy, satire,
criticism of bona-fide politicians, journalists, moralists, satirists
and of the ever-present hordes of parasites and hangers-on. Some cooks
became confidants, even friends and advisors of men in high places,
emperors, (cf. life of Vitellius) and through their subtle influence
upon the mighty they may have contributed in no mean measure to the
fate of the nation. But such invisible string-pullers have not been
confined to those days alone. (Take Rasputin! Take the valet to
William I, reputed to have had more &quot;say&quot; than the mighty Bismarck,
who, as it developed, got &quot;the air&quot; while the valet died in his
berth.)</p>
<p>Such being the case, what potential power reposed in a greasy cookery
manuscript! And, if so, why bare such wonderful secrets to Tom, Dick
and Harry?</p>
<p>Weights and measures are given by Apicius in some instances. But just
such figures can be used artfully to conceal a trap. Any mediocre
cook, gaining possession of a choice collection of detailed and
itemized recipes would have been placed in an enviable position.
Experimenting for some time (at his master&#39;s expense) he would soon
reach that perfection when he could demand a handsome compensation for
his ministrations. Throughout antique times, throughout the middle
ages down to the present day (when patent laws no longer protect a
secret) strict secrecy was maintained around many useful and lucrative
formulæ, not only by cooks, but also by physicians, alchemists and the
various scientists, artisans and craftsmen. Only the favorite
apprentice would be made heir to or shareholder in this important
stock in trade after his worthiness had been proven to his master&#39;s
satisfaction, usually by the payment of a goodly sum of
money—apprentice&#39;s pay. We remember reading in Lanciani (Rodolfo L.:
Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries) how in the entire
history of Rome there is but one voice, that of a solitary,
noble-minded physician, complaining about the secrecy that was being
maintained by his colleagues as regards their science. To be sure,
those fellows had every reason in the world for keeping quiet: so
preposterous were their methods in most cases! This secrecy indeed
must have carried with it a blessing in disguise. Professional reserve
was not its object. The motive was purely commercial.</p>
<p>Seeing where the information given by Apicius is out of reason and
unintelligible we are led to believe that such text is by no means to
be taken very literally. On the contrary, it is quite probable that
weights and measures are not correct: they are quite likely to be of
an artful and studied unreliability. A secret private code is often
employed, necessitating the elimination or transposition of certain
words, figures or letters before the whole will become intelligible
and useful. If by any chance an uninitiated hand should attempt to
grasp such veiled directions, failure would be certain. We confess to
have employed at an early stage of our own career this same strategy
and time-honored camouflage to protect a precious lot of recipes.
Promptly we lost this unctuous manuscript, as we feared we would; if
not deciphered today, the book has long since been discarded as being
a record of the ravings of a madman.</p>
<p>The advent of the printing press changed the situation. With Platina,
ca. 1474, an avalanche of cookery literature started. The secrets of
Scappi, &quot;<em>cuoco secreto</em>&quot; to the pope, were &quot;scooped&quot; by an
enterprising Venetian printer in 1570. The guilds of French mustard
makers and sauce cooks (precursors of modern food firms and
manufacturers of ready-made condiments) were a powerful tribe of
secret mongers in the middle ages. English gastronomic literature of
the 16th, 17th and even the 18th century is crowded with &quot;closets
opened,&quot; &quot;secrets let out&quot; and other alluring titles purporting to
regale the prospective reader with profitable and appetizing secrets
of all sorts. Kitchen secrets became commercial articles.</p>
<p>These remarks should suffice to illustrate the assumption that the
Apicius book was not created for publication but that it is a
collection of abridged formulæ for private use, a treasure chest as it
were, of some cook, which after the demise of its owner, collector,
originator, a curious world could not resist to play with, although
but a few experienced masters held the key, being able to make use of
the recipes.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="meat-diet">MEAT DIET</h4>
<p>In perusing Apicius only one or two instances of cruelty to animals
have come to our attention (cf. recipes No. 140 and 259). Cruel
methods of slaughter were common. Some of the dumb beasts that were to
feed man and even had to contribute to his pleasures and enjoyment of
life by giving up their own lives often were tortured in cruel,
unspeakable ways. The belief existed that such methods might increase
the quality, palatability and flavor of the meat. Such beliefs and
methods may still be encountered on the highways and byways in Europe
and Asia today. Since the topic, strictly speaking does not belong
here, we cannot depict it in detail, and in passing make mention of it
to refer students interested in the psychology of the ancients to such
details as are found in the writings of Plutarch and other ancient
writers during the early Christian era. It must be remembered,
however, that such writers (including the irreproachable Plutarch)
were advocates of vegetarianism. Some passages are inspired by true
humane feeling, but much appears to be written in the interest of
vegetarianism.</p>
<p>The ancients were not such confirmed meat eaters as the modern Western
nations, merely because the meat supply was not so ample. Beef was
scarce because of the shortage of large pastures. The cow was sacred,
the ox furnished motive power, and, after its usefulness was gone, the
muscular old brute had little attraction for the gourmet. Today lives
a race of beef eaters. Our beef diet, no doubt is bound to change
somewhat. Already the world&#39;s grazing grounds are steadily
diminishing. The North American prairies are being parcelled off into
small farms the working conditions of which make beef raising
expensive. The South American pampas and a strip of coastal land in
Australia now furnish the bulk of the world&#39;s beef supply. Perhaps
Northern Asia still holds in store a large future supply of meat but
this no doubt will be claimed by Asia. Already North America is
acclimating the Lapland reindeer to offset the waning beef, to utilize
its Northern wastes.</p>
<p>With the increasing shortage of beef, with the increasing facilities
for raising chicken and pork, a reversion to Apician methods of
cookery and diet is not only probably but actually seems inevitable.
The ancient bill of fare and the ancient methods of cookery were
entirely guided by the supply of raw materials—precisely like ours.
They had no great food stores nor very efficient marketing and
transportation systems, food cold storage. They knew, however, to take
care of what there was. They were good managers.</p>
<p>Such atrocities as the willful destruction of huge quantities of food
of every description on the one side and starving multitudes on the
other as seen today never occurred in antiquity.</p>
<p>Many of the Apician dishes will not appeal to the beef eaters. It is
worthy of note that much criticism was heaped upon Apicius some 200
years ago in England when beef eating became fashionable in that
country. The art of Apicius requires practitioners of superior
intellect. Indeed, it requires a superior clientèle to appreciate
Apician dishes. But practitioners that would pass the requirements of
the Apician school are scarce in the kitchens of the beef eaters. We
cannot blame meat eaters for rejecting the average <em>chef d&#39;œuvre</em>
set before them by a mediocre cook who has learned little besides the
roasting or broiling of meats. Once the average man has acquired a
taste for the refined compositions made by a talented and experienced
cook, say, a composition of meats, vegetables or cereals, properly
&quot;balanced&quot; by that intuition that never fails the real artist, the
fortunate diner will eventually curtail the preponderant meat diet. A
glance at some Chinese and Japanese methods of cookery may perhaps
convince us of the probability of these remarks.</p>
<p>Nothing is more perplexing and more alarming than a new dish, but we
can see in a reversion to Apician cookery methods only a dietetic
benefit accruing to this so-called white race of beef eaters.</p>
<p>Apicius certainly excels in the preparation of vegetable dishes (cf.
his cabbage and asparagus) and in the utilization of parts of food
materials that are today considered inferior, hardly worth preparing
for the table except by the very careful and economical housekeeper.
Properly prepared, many of these things are good, often more
nutritious than the dearer cuts, and sometimes they are really
delicious.</p>
<p>One has but to study the methods of ancient and intelligent people who
have suffered for thousands of years under the perennial shortage of
food supplies in order to understand and to appreciate Apician
methods. Be it far from us to advocate their methods, or to wish upon
us the conditions that engendered such methods; for such practices
have been pounded into these people by dire necessity. They have
graduated from the merciless school of hunger.</p>
<p>Food materials, we repeat, were never as cheap and as abundant as they
are today. But who can say that they always will be so in the future?</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="science-confirming-ancient-methods">SCIENCE CONFIRMING ANCIENT METHODS</h4>
<p>We must not overlook the remarkable intuition displayed by the
ancients in giving preference to foods with body- and blood-building
properties. For instance, the use of liver, particularly fish liver
already referred to. The correctness of their choice is now being
confirmed by scientific re-discoveries. The young science of nutrition
is important enough to an individual who would stimulate or preserve
his health. But since constitutions are different, the most carefully
conceived dietary may apply to one particular individual only,
provided, however, that our present knowledge of nutrition be correct
and final. This knowledge, as a matter of fact, is being revised and
changed constantly.</p>
<p>If dietetics, therefore, were important enough to have any bearing at
all upon the well-defined methods of cookery, we might go into detail
analyzing ancient methods from that point of view. To call attention
to the &quot;economy,&quot; the stewardship, or craftsmanship, in ancient
methods and to the truly remarkable intuition that guided the ancient
cooks is more important. Without these qualities there can be no
higher gastronomy. Without high gastronomy no high civilization is
possible. The honest and experienced nutrition expert, though perhaps
personally opposed to elaborate dining, will discover through close
study of the ancient precepts interesting pre-scientific and
well-balanced combinations and methods designed to jealously guard the
vitamins and dietetic values in dishes that may appear curiously &quot;new&quot;
to the layman that would nevertheless receive the unqualified approval
of modern science.</p>
<p>We respect the efforts of modern dietitians and food reformers; but we
are far removed from the so-called &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;plain&quot; foods
advocated by some well-meaning individuals. With the progress of
civilization we are farther and farther drifting away from it. Even
barbaric and beastly food is not &quot;simple.&quot;</p>
<p>This furtive &quot;intuition&quot; in cookery (in the absence of scientific
facts because of the inability of cooks to transform empirical
traditions into practical rules emanating from understood principles)
still prevails today. It guides great chefs, saves time spent in
scientific study.</p>
<p>The much criticized &quot;unnatural union of sugar and meats&quot; of the
ancients still exists today in many popular examples of cookery: lamb
and mint sauce, steak and catsup, mutton and currant jelly, pork and
apples (in various forms), oyster cocktail, poultry and compôte, goose
with apple and raisin dressing, venison and Cumberland sauce, mince
pie, plum pudding—typical survivals of ancient traditions.
&quot;Intuition&quot; is still preceding exact science, and &quot;unnatural unions&quot;
as in social, political and any other form of life, seem to be the
rule rather than the exception.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="disguising-foods">DISGUISING FOODS</h4>
<p>Apicius is often blamed for his endeavor to serve one thing under the
guise of another. The reasons for such deceptions are various ones.
Fashion dictated it. Cooks were not considered &quot;clever&quot; unless they
could surprise guests with a commonplace food material so skillfully
prepared that identification was difficult or impossible. Another
reason was the absence of good refrigeration, making &quot;masking&quot;
necessary. Also the ambition of hosts to serve a cheaper food for a
more expensive one—veal for chicken, pork for partridge, and so on.
But do we not indulge in the same &quot;stunts&quot; today? We either do it with
the intention of deceiving or to &quot;show off.&quot; Have we not &quot;Mock Turtle
Soup,&quot; <em>Mouton à la Chasseur</em>, mutton prepared to taste like venison,
&quot;chicken&quot; salad made of veal or of rabbit? In Europe even today much
of the traditional roast hare is caught in the alley, and it belongs
to a feline species. &quot;Roof hare.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="food-adulterations">FOOD ADULTERATIONS</h4>
<p>There is positive evidence of downright frauds and vicious food
adulteration in the times of Apicius. The old rascal himself is not
above giving directions for rose wine without roses, or how to make a
spoiled honey marketable, and other similar adulterations. Those of
our readers with sensitive gastronomic instinct had better skip the
paragraphs discussing the treatment of &quot;birds with a goatish smell.&quot;
But the old food adulterators are no match for their modern
successors.</p>
<p>Too, some of our own shams are liable to misinterpretation. In
centuries to come our own modern recipes for &quot;Scotch Woodcock&quot; or
&quot;Welsh rabbit&quot; may be interpreted as attempts on our part to hoodwink
guests by making game birds and rabbits out of cheese and bread, like
Trimalchio&#39;s culinary artists are reputed to have made suckling pigs
out of dough, partridges of veal, chicken of tunny fish, and <em>vice
versa</em>. What indeed would a serious-minded research worker a thousand
years hence if unfamiliar with our culinary practice and traditions
make of such terms as <em>pette de nonne</em> as found in many old French
cookery books, or of the famous <em>suttelties</em> (subtleties)—the
confections once so popular at medieval weddings?</p>
<p>The ramifications of the <em>lingua coquinaria</em> in any country are
manifold, and the culinary wonderland is full of pitfalls even for the
experienced gourmet.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="reaching-the-limit">REACHING THE LIMIT</h4>
<p>Like in all other branches of ancient endeavor, cookery had reached a
state of perfection around the time of Apicius when the only chance
for successful continuation of the art lay in the conquest of new
fields, i.e., in expansion, generalization, elaboration and in
influence from foreign sources. We have witnessed this in French
cookery which for the last hundred years has successfully expanded and
has virtually captured the civilized parts of the globe, subject
however, always to regional and territorial modifications.</p>
<p>This desirable expansion of antique cookery did not take place. It was
violently and rather suddenly checked principally by political and
economic events during the centuries following Apicius, perhaps
principally by the forces that caused the great migration (the very
quest of food!). Suspension ensued instead. The heirs to the ancient
culture were not yet ready for their marvelous heritage. Besides their
cultural unpreparedness, the cookery of the ancients, like their
humor, did not readily appeal to the &quot;Nordic&quot; heirs. Both are so
subtle and they depend so much upon the psychology and the economic
conditions of a people, and they thus presented almost unsurmountable
obstacles to the invaders. Still lo! already in the fifth century, the
Goth Vinithaharjis, started to collect the Apician precepts.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="our-predecessors">OUR PREDECESSORS</h4>
<p>The usefulness in our days of Apicius as a practical cookery book has
been questioned, but we leave this to our readers to decide after the
perusal of this translation.</p>
<p>If not useful in the kitchen, if we cannot grasp its moral, what,
then, is Apicius? Merely a curio?</p>
<p>The existing manuscripts cannot be bought; the old printed editions
are highly priced by collectors, and they are rare. Still, the few
persons able to read the messages therein cannot use them: they are
not practitioners in cookery.</p>
<p>None of the Apician editors (except Danneil and the writer) were
experienced practising gastronomers. Humelbergius, Lister, Bernhold
were medical men. Two serious students, Schuch and Wuestemann, gave up
academic positions to devote a year to the study of modern cookery in
order to be able to interpret Apicius. These enthusiasts overlooked,
however, two facts: Apicius cannot be understood by inquiring into
modern average cookery methods, nor can complete mastery of cookery,
practical as well as theoretical, including the historical and
physiological aspects of gastronomy be acquired in one year. Richard
Gollmer, another Apicius editor, declares that the results of this
course in gastronomy were negative. We might add here that Schuch&#39;s
edition of Apicius, apart from the unwarranted inclusion of the
<em>excerpta</em> of Vinidarius is the least reliable of all editions.</p>
<p>Gollmer published a free version of Apicius in German in 1909. If he
did not render the original very faithfully and literally, it must
be said in all fairness that his methods of procedure were correct.
Gollmer attempted to interpret the ancient text for the modern
reader. Unfortunately he based his work upon that of Schuch and
Wuestemann and Lister. A year or so later Eduard Danneil published a
version of his own, also based on Schuch. This editor is a
practising <em>chef</em>,—<em>Hof-Traiteur</em> or caterer to the court of one of
the then reigning princes of Germany. Danneil&#39;s preface is dated
1897, though the date of publication is 1911. In view of the fact
that Gollmer had covered the ground and that Danneil added nothing
new to Apician lore, his publication seems superfluous. Danneil&#39;s
translation differs in that the translator adhered literally to the
questionable Schuch version whereas Gollmer aspired to a free and
readable version for an educated public.</p>
<p>A comparison reveals that the one author is not a cook while the other
is not a savant.</p>
<p>Like the scholars who tried their hand at cookery, there are a number
of worthy and ambitious practitioners of cookery who have endeavored
to reach the heights of scholarship, among them Carême and Soyer, men
of great calibre. Unfortunately, the span of human life is short, the
capacity of the human mind is limited. Fruitful achievements in widely
different fields of endeavor by one man are rare. This is merely to
illustrate the extreme difficulty encountered by anyone bent on a
venturesome exploration of our subject and the very narrow chances of
success to extricate himself with grace from the two-thousand year old
labyrinth of philosophical, historical, linguistical and gastronomical
technicalities.</p>
<p>This task will become comparatively easy, however, and surely
interesting and with a foreboding of many delights and surprises if we
penetrate the jungle aided by the experience of predecessors,
steadfastly relying on the &quot;theory of evolution&quot; as a guide, and armed
with the indispensable equipment for gastronomical research, i.e., the
practical and technical knowledge of cookery, mastery of languages,
augmented by practical experience gathered by observations and travel
in many lands, and last but not least, if we are obsessed with the
fixed idea that so menial a subject is worth all the bother.</p>
<p>We have purposely refrained from presenting here a treatise in the
customary scientific style. We know, there are repetitions,
digressions, excursions into adjacent fields that may be open to
criticism. We really do not aim to make this critical review an
exhibition of scholarly attainments with all the necessary brevity,
clarity, scientific restraint and etiquette. Such style would be
entirely out of our line. Any bookish flavor attaching itself to our
work would soon replace a natural fragrance we aim to preserve, namely
our close contact with the subject. Those interested in the scholarly
work that has been contributed to this cause are referred to modern
men like Vollmer, Giarratano, Brandt and others named in the
bibliography. Of the older scientists there is Martinus Lister, a man
whose knowledge of the subject is very respectable and whose devotion
to it is unbounded, whose integrity as a scientist is above reproach.
His notes and commentaries together with those of Humelbergius, the
editor-physician of Zürich, will be enjoyed and read with profit by
every antiquary. The labors of Bernhold and Schuch are meritorious
also, the work, time, and <em>esprit</em> these men have devoted to the
subject is enormous. As for Torinus, the opinions are divided.
Humelbergius ignores him, Gryphius pirates him, Lister scorns him, we
like him. Lister praises his brother physician, Humelbergius: <em>Doctus
quidem vir et modestus!</em> So he is! The notes by Humelbergius alone and
his word: <em>Nihil immutare ausi summus!</em> entitles him to all the praise
Lister can bestow. Unfortunately, the sources of his information are
unknown.</p>
<p>Lacking these, we have of course no means of ascertaining whether he
always lived up to his word that he is not privileged to change.
Humelbergius and Lister may have made contributions of value from a
philological point of view but their work appears to have less merit
gastronomically than that of Torinus. To us the Basel editor often
seems surprisingly correct in cases where the gastronomical character
of a formula is in doubt.</p>
<p>In rendering the ancient text into English we, too, have endeavored to
follow Humelbergii example; hence the almost literal translation of
the originals before us, namely, Torinus, Humelbergius, Lister,
Bernhold, Schuch and the latest, Giarratano-Vollmer which reached us
in 1925 in time for collating. We have wavered often and long whether
or not to place alongside this English version the original Latin
text, but due to the divergencies we have finally abandoned the idea,
for practical reasons alone.</p>
<p>In translating we have endeavored to clear up mysteries and errors;
this interpretation is a work quite apart and independent of that of
the translation. It is merely the sum and substance of our practical
experience in gastronomy. It is not to be taken as an attempt to
change the original but is presented in good faith, to be taken on its
face value. This interpretation appears in the form of notes directly
under each article, for quick reference and it is our wish that it be
of some practical service in contributing to the general understanding
and appreciation of our ancient book.</p>
<p>For the sake of expediency we have numbered and placed a title (in
English) on each ancient recipe, following the example of Schuch. This
procedure may be counted against us as a liberty taken with the text.
The text has remained inviolate. We have merely aimed at a rational
and legible presentation—work within the province and the duty of an
editor-translator and technical expert.</p>
<p>We do not claim credit for any other work connected with the task of
making this most unique book accessible to the English speaking public
and for the competition for scholastic laurels we wish to stay <em>hors
de combat</em>. We feel we are not privileged to pass final judgment upon
the excellent work done by sympathetic and erudite admirers of our
ancient book throughout the better part of four centuries, and we
cannot side with one or the other in questions philological,
historical, or of any other nature, except gastronomical. We are
deeply indebted to all of our predecessors and through conversations
and extensive correspondence with other modern researchers, Dr. Edward
Brandt and Dr. Margaret B. Wilson, we are enabled to predict new
developments in Apician research. The debates of the scientists, it
appears, are not yet closed.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the various differences of opinion in minor
questions are of little import to us as compared with the delightful
fact that we here possess an Apicius, not only a genuine Roman, but an
&quot;honest-to-goodness&quot; human being besides. A jolly fellow is Apicius
with a basketful of happy messages for a hungry world. We therefore
want to make this work of ours the entertainment and instruction the
subject deserves to be. If we succeed in proving that Apicius is not a
mummified, bone-dry classic but that he has &quot;the goods,&quot; namely some
real human merit we shall have accomplished more than the savants to
whom this popularization of our hero has been denied so far.</p>
<p>After all, we live in a practical age, and it is the practical value,
the matter-of-fact contribution to our happiness and well-being by the
work of any man, ancient or modern, which counts in these days of
materialism.</p>
<p>So let us tell the truth, and let us sum up in a few words:</p>
<p>We do not know who Apicius is. We do not know who wrote the book
bearing his name. We do not know when it was written, or whether it
is of Greek or of Roman origin. Furthermore, we do not understand many
of its precepts!</p>
<p>We do know, however, that it is the oldest work dealing with the food
and the cookery of the ancient world&#39;s greatest empire, and that, as
such, it is of the utmost interest and importance to us.</p>
<p>In this sense we have endeavored to treat the book.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="dining-in-apician-style">DINING IN APICIAN STYLE</h4>
<p>Past attempts to dine à l&#39;Apicius invariably have ended disastrously.
Eager <em>gourmets</em>, ever on the look-out for something new, and curious
scholars have attempted to prepare dishes in the manner prescribed by
Apicius. Most of such experimenters have executed the old precepts
literally, instead of trying to enter into their spirit.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Das Land der Griechen mit der Seele suchen!</em>&quot; says Goethe. The
friends of Apicius who failed to heed this advice, also failed to
comprehend the precepts, they were cured of their curiosity, and
blamed the master for their own shortcomings. Christina, queen of
Sweden, was made ill by an attempt of this kind to regale her majesty
with a rare Apician morsel while in Italy as the guest of some noble.
But history is dark on this point. Here perhaps Apicius is blamed for
a dastardly attempt on the royal lady&#39;s life for this daughter of the
Protestant Gustavus Adolphus was in those days not the only crowned
head in danger of being dispatched by means of some tempting morsel
smilingly proffered by some titled rogue. A deadly dish under the
disguise of &quot;Apicius&quot; must have been particularly convenient in those
days for such sinister purposes. The sacred obligations imposed upon
&quot;barbarians&quot; by the virtue of hospitality had been often forgotten by
the super-refined hosts of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>But Apicius continued to prove unhealthful to a number of later
amateurs. Lister, with his perfectly sincere endeavor to popularize
Apicius, achieved precisely the opposite. The publication of his work
in London, 1705, was the signal for a number of people, scholars and
others, to crack jokes, not at the expense of Apicius, as they
imagined, but to expose their own ignorance. Smollet, Dr. W. King
(&quot;Poor starving wit&quot;—Swift), Dr. Hunter and others. More recently, a
party of English dandies, chaperoned, if we remember correctly, by the
ponderous George Augustus Sala, fared likewise badly in their attempt
to stage a Roman feast, being under the impression that the days of
Tiberius and the mid-Victorian era may be joined with impunity, <em>à la
minute</em>, as it were.</p>
<p>Even later, in one of the (alas! not so many) good books on
gastronomy, &quot;Kettner&#39;s Book of the Table,&quot; London, 1877, the excellent
author dismisses Roman cookery with a few lines of &quot;warning.&quot; Kettner,
admirer of Sala, evidently was still under the baneful influence.
Twenty years later, Danneil, colleague of Kettner&#39;s, joined the chorus
of &quot;irreverent critics.&quot; They all based their judgment on mere idle
conversation, resulting from disappointments in ill-fated attempts to
cook in the Apician style. Even the best experts, it appears, fall
victims to the mysterious spell surrounding, protecting things of
sacred antiquity, hovering like an avenging angel over them, to ward
off all &quot;irreverent critics&quot; and curious intruders.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="the-proof-of-the-pudding">THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING</h4>
<p>After all, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. This homely
solid wisdom is literally true of our good old Apicius. We have tested
many of his precepts, and have found them practical, good, even
delightful. A few, we will say, are of the rarest beauty and of
consummate perfection in the realm of gastronomy, while some others
again are totally unintelligible for reasons sufficiently explained.
Always remembering Humelbergius, we have &quot;laid off&quot; of these torsos,
recommending them to some more competent commentator. Many of the
ancient formula tried have our unqualified gastronomic approval.</p>
<p>If our work has not differed from that of our predecessors, if it
shows the same human frailties and foibles, we have at least one mark
of distinction among the editors in that we have subjected the
original to severe practical tests as much as this is possible with
our modern food materials. We experienced difficulty in securing
certain spices long out of use. Nevertheless, the experience of
actually sampling Apician dishes and the sensation of dining in the
manners of the Cæsars are worth the trouble we took with Apicius. This
is a feeling of partaking of an entirely new dish, met with both
expectancy and with suspicion, accentuated by the hallowed traditions
surrounding it which has rewarded us for the time and expense devoted
to the subject. Ever since we have often dined in the classical
fashion of the ancients who, after all, were but &quot;folks&quot; like
ourselves.</p>
<p>If you care not for the carnal pleasures in Apician gastronomy—for
<em>gulam</em>,—if you don&#39;t give a fig for philology, there still is something
healthy, something infinitely soothing and comforting—&quot;educational&quot;—in
the perusal of the old book and in similar records.</p>
<p>When we see Apicius, the famous &quot;epicure&quot; descending to the very level
of a common food &quot;fakir,&quot; giving directions for making Liburnian oil
that has never seen that country....</p>
<p>When we note, with a gentle shudder, that the grafters of Naples,
defying even the mighty Augustus, leveled the &quot;White Earth Hill&quot; near
Puteoli because an admixture of plaster paris is exceedingly
profitable to the milling profession....</p>
<p>When Apicius—celebrated glutton—resorts to the comparatively
harmless &quot;stunt&quot; of keeping fresh vegetables green by boiling them in
a copper kettle with soda....</p>
<p>When we behold hordes of ancient legislators, posing as dervishes of
moderation, secretly and openly breaking the prohibition laws of their
own making....</p>
<p>When we turn away from such familiar sights and, in a more jovial
mood, heartily laugh at the jokes of that former mill slave, Plautus
(who could not pay his bills) and when we wonder why his wise cracks
sound so familiar we remember that we have heard their modern versions
only yesterday at the Tivoli on State Street....</p>
<p>When, finally, in the company of our respected Horatius we hear him
say in the slang of his day: <em>Ab ovo usque ad mala</em>, and compare this
bright saying with our own dear &quot;From Soup to Nuts.&quot;...</p>
<p>Then we arrive at the comforting conclusion that we moderns are either
very ancient and backward or that indeed the ancients are very modern
and progressive; and it is our only regret that we cannot decide this
perplexing situation to our lasting satisfaction.</p>
<p>Very true, there may be nothing new under the sun, yet nature goes on
eternally fashioning new things from old materials. Eternally
demolishing old models in a manner of an economical sculptor, nature
uses the same old clay to create new specimens. Sometimes nature
slightly alters the patterns, discarding what is unfit for her
momentary enigmatic purposes, retaining and favoring that which
pleases her whimsical fancy for the time being.</p>
<p>Cookery deals exclusively with nature&#39;s works. Books on cookery are
essentially books on nature&#39;s actions and reactions.</p>
<p>In the perpetual search for perfection, life has accomplished one
remarkable thing: the development of man, the animal which cooks.
Gradually nature has revealed herself to man principally through the
food he takes, cooks and prepares for the enjoyment of himself and his
fellow men.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="the-cooking-animal">THE COOKING ANIMAL</h4>
<p>The gastronomer is the highest development of the cooking animal.</p>
<p>He—artist, philosopher, metaphysician, religionist—stands with his
head bared before nature: overawed, contemplating her gifts, feasting
his eyes on beauteous forms and colors, inhaling intoxicating
fragrances, aromas, odors, matching them all artistically, partaking
only of what he needs for his own subsistence—eternally marveling at
nature&#39;s inexhaustible resources and inventiveness, at her everlasting
bounty born of everlasting fierce struggles.</p>
<p>The gastronomer is grateful for the privilege of holding the
custodianship of such precious things, and he guards it like an office
of a sacred rite—ever gratefully, reverently adoring, cherishing the
things before him ... ever marveling ... ever alone, alone with
nature.</p>
<p>As for the overwhelming majority of the cooking animals, they behave
much more &quot;naturally.&quot; They are a merry crowd, ever anticipating a
good time, ever jolly, eager, greedy. Or, they are cranky, hungry,
starved, miserable, and they turn savage now and then. Some are
gluttonous. Many contract indigestion—nature&#39;s most subtle
punishment.</p>
<p>If they were told that they must kill before they may cook—that might
spoil the appetite and dinner joy of many a tender-hearted devourer of
fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid! Being real children of nature, and behaving naturally,
nature likes them, and we, too, certainly are well pleased with the
majority.</p>
<p>The only fly in the ointment of life is that we don&#39;t know what it is
all about, and probably never will know.</p>

<p>[1] FINE SPICED WINE
  <em>CONDITUM PARADOXUM</em></p>
<p>THE COMPOSITION OF [this] EXCELLENT SPICED WINE [is as follows]. INTO
A COPPER BOWL PUT 6 SEXTARII [1] OF HONEY AND 2 SEXTARII OF WINE; HEAT
ON A SLOW FIRE, CONSTANTLY STIRRING THE MIXTURE WITH A WHIP. AT THE
BOILING POINT ADD A DASH OF COLD WINE, RETIRE FROM STOVE AND SKIM.
REPEAT THIS TWICE OR THREE TIMES, LET IT REST TILL THE NEXT DAY, AND
SKIM AGAIN. THEN ADD 4 OZS. OF CRUSHED PEPPER [2], 3 SCRUPLES OF
MASTICH, A DRACHM EACH OF [nard or laurel] LEAVES AND SAFFRON, 5
DRACHMS OF ROASTED DATE STONES CRUSHED AND PREVIOUSLY SOAKED IN WINE
TO SOFTEN THEM. WHEN THIS IS PROPERLY DONE ADD 18 SEXTARII OF LIGHT
WINE. TO CLARIFY IT PERFECTLY, ADD [crushed] CHARCOAL [3] TWICE OR AS
OFTEN AS NECESSARY WHICH WILL DRAW [the residue] TOGETHER [and
carefully strain or filter through the charcoal].</p>
<pre><code>[1] _Sextarii._ Tor. _partes XV_; G.-V. _pondo XV_;
List. _partes XV ... pondo lib.... qui continent
sextarios sex_. One sextarius (a &quot;sixth&quot;) equals about
1-1/2 pint English.

[2] Pepper. _Piperis uncias IV_—ordinarily our black or
white pepper grains, but in connection with honey,
sweets, and so forth, the term &quot;pepper&quot; may just as well
stand for our allspice, or even for any spicing in
general.

[3] Charcoal. Still a favorite filterer for liquors.

List. Apicius is correct in starting his book with this
formula, as all meals were started with this sort of
mixed drink.

Tor. deviates from the other texts in that he elaborates
on the cooking process.</code></pre><p>[2] HONEY REFRESHER FOR TRAVELERS
  <em>CONDITUM MELIZOMUM _[1]</em> VIATORIUM_</p>
<p>THE WAYFARER&#39;S HONEY REFRESHER (SO CALLED BECAUSE IT GIVES ENDURANCE
AND STRENGTH TO PEDESTRIANS) [2] WITH WHICH TRAVELERS ARE REFRESHED BY
THE WAYSIDE IS MADE IN THIS MANNER: FLAVOR HONEY WITH GROUND PEPPER
AND SKIM. IN THE MOMENT OF SERVING PUT HONEY IN A CUP, AS MUCH AS IS
DESIRED TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT DEGREE OF SWEETNESS, AND MIX SPICED WINE
NOT MORE THAN A NEEDED QUANTITY; ALSO ADD SOME WINE TO THE SPICED
HONEY TO FACILITATE ITS FLOW AND THE MIXING.</p>
<pre><code>[1] Tor. _Melirhomum_; _non extat_. G.-V. M.
_perpetuum_, i.e., having good keeping qualities.

[2] Tor. reads thus whereas others apply &quot;endurance&quot; to
the honey itself. The honey could not be preserved
(_perpetuum_) by the addition of pepper. Any addition,
as a matter of fact, would hasten its deterioration
unless the honey were boiled and sealed tight, which the
original takes for granted.</code></pre><h4 id="ii">II.</h4>
<p>[3] ROMAN VERMOUTH
  <em>ABSINTHIUM ROMANUM</em> [1]</p>
<p>ROMAN VERMOUTH [or Absinth] IS MADE THUS: ACCORDING TO THE RECIPE OF
CAMERINUM [2] YOU NEED WORMWOOD FROM SANTO [3] FOR ROMAN VERMOUTH OR,
AS A SUBSTITUTE, WORMWOOD FROM THE PONTUS [4] CLEANED AND CRUSHED, 1
THEBAN OUNCE [5] OF IT, 6 SCRUPLES OF MASTICH, 3 EACH OF [nard]
LEAVES, COSTMARY [6] AND SAFFRON AND 18 QUARTS OF ANY KIND OF MILD
WINE. [Filter cold] CHARCOAL IS NOT REQUIRED BECAUSE OF THE
BITTERNESS.</p>
<pre><code>[1] G.-V. _Apsinthium_.

[2] The mention of a name in a recipe is very
infrequent. Camerinum is a town in Umbria.

[3] Now Saintonge, Southern France.

[4] Black Sea Region.

[5] Weight of indefinite volume, from Thebæ, one of the
several ancient cities by that name. List. thinks it is
an Egyptian ounce, and that the author of the recipe
must be an African.

[6] Wanting in Tor.; G.-V. _costi scripulos senos_.</code></pre><h4 id="iii">III.</h4>
<p>[4] ROSE WINE [1]
  <em>ROSATUM</em></p>
<p>MAKE ROSE WINE IN THIS MANNER: ROSE PETALS, THE LOWER WHITE PART
REMOVED, SEWED INTO A LINEN BAG AND IMMERSED IN WINE FOR SEVEN DAYS.
THEREUPON ADD A SACK OF NEW PETALS WHICH ALLOW TO DRAW FOR ANOTHER
SEVEN DAYS. AGAIN REMOVE THE OLD PETALS AND REPLACE THEM BY FRESH ONES
FOR ANOTHER WEEK; THEN STRAIN THE WINE THROUGH THE COLANDER. BEFORE
SERVING, ADD HONEY SWEETENING TO TASTE. TAKE CARE THAT ONLY THE BEST
PETALS FREE FROM DEW BE USED FOR SOAKING.</p>
<pre><code>[1] Used principally as a laxative medicine. List. These
wines compounded of roses and violets move the bowels
strongly.</code></pre><p>[5] VIOLET WINE
  <em>VIOLATIUM</em></p>
<p>IN A SIMILAR WAY AS ABOVE LIKE THE ROSE WINE VIOLET WINE IS MADE OF
FRESH VIOLETS, AND TEMPERED WITH HONEY, AS DIRECTED.</p>
<p>[6] ROSE WINE WITHOUT [1] ROSES
  <em>ROSATUM SINE ROSA</em></p>
<p>ROSE WINE WITHOUT ROSES IS MADE IN THIS FASHION: A PALM LEAF BASKET
FULL OF FRESH CITRUS LEAVES IS IMMERSED IN THE VAT OF NEW WINE BEFORE
FERMENTATION HAS SET IN. AFTER FORTY DAYS RETIRE THE LEAVES, AND, AS
OCCASION ARISES, SWEETEN THE WINE WITH HONEY, AND PASS IT UP FOR ROSE
WINE.</p>
<pre><code>[1] A substitute.</code></pre><h4 id="iv">IV.</h4>
<p>[7] LIBURNIAN OIL
  <em>OLEUM LIBURNICUM</em></p>
<p>IN ORDER TO MAKE AN OIL SIMILAR TO THE LIBURNIAN OIL PROCEED AS
FOLLOWS: IN SPANISH OIL PUT [the following mixture of] ELECAMPANE,
CYPRIAN RUSH AND GREEN LAUREL LEAVES THAT ARE NOT TOO OLD, ALL OF IT
CRUSHED AND MACERATED AND REDUCED TO A FINE POWDER. SIFT THIS IN AND
ADD FINELY GROUND SALT AND STIR INDUSTRIOUSLY FOR THREE DAYS OR MORE.
THEN ALLOW TO SETTLE. EVERYBODY WILL TAKE THIS FOR LIBURNIAN OIL. [1]</p>
<pre><code>[1] Like the above a flagrant case of food adulteration.</code></pre><h4 id="v">V.</h4>
<p>[8] TO CLARIFY MUDDY WINE
  <em>VINUM EX ATRO CANDIDUM FACIES</em></p>
<p>PUT BEAN MEAL AND THE WHITES OF THREE EGGS IN A MIXING BOWL. MIX
THOROUGHLY WITH A WHIP AND ADD TO THE WINE, STIRRING FOR A LONG TIME.
THE NEXT DAY THE WINE WILL BE CLEAR [1]. ASHES OF VINES HAVE THE SAME
EFFECT.</p>
<pre><code>[1] Ex Lister whose version we prefer. He says, _Alias
die erit candidum_ while Tor. adds white salt, saying,
_sal si adieceris candidum_, same as Tac. This is
unusual, although the ancients have at times treated
wine with sea water.</code></pre><h4 id="vi">VI.</h4>
<p>[9] TO IMPROVE A BROTH [1]
  <em>DE LIQUAMINE EMENDANDO</em> [2]</p>
<p>IF BROTH HAS CONTRACTED A BAD ODOR, PLACE A VESSEL UPSIDE DOWN AND
FUMIGATE IT WITH LAUREL AND CYPRESS AND BEFORE VENTILATING [3] IT,
POUR THE BROTH IN THIS VESSEL. IF THIS DOES NOT HELP MATTERS [4] AND
IF THE TASTE IS TOO PRONOUNCED, ADD HONEY AND FRESH SPIKENARD [5] TO
IT; THAT WILL IMPROVE IT. ALSO NEW MUST SHOULD BE LIKEWISE EFFECTIVE
[6].</p>
<pre><code>[1] List. _Liquamen, id est, garum_. Goll. Fish sauce.

[2] Tor. _Qui liquamen corruptum corrigatur_.

[3] Dann. Ventilate it. Goll. Whip the sauce in fresh
air.

[4] List., G.-V. _si salsum fuerit_—if this makes it
too salty—Tor. _si hoc nihil effecerit_.

[5] Tor. _novem spicam immittas_; List. _Move spica_;
Goll.-Dann. stir with a whip.

[6] A classic example of Apician confusion when one
interpreter reads &quot;s&quot; for &quot;f&quot; and &quot;_novem_&quot; for &quot;_move_&quot;
and another reads something else. Tor. is more correct
than the others, but this formula is beyond redemption.
Fate has decreed that ill-smelling broths shall be
discarded.</code></pre><h4 id="vii">VII.</h4>
<p>[10] TO KEEP MEATS FRESH WITHOUT SALT FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME
   <em>UT CARNES SINE SALE QUOVIS TEMPORE RECENTES SINT</em></p>
<p>COVER FRESH MEAT WITH HONEY, SUSPEND IT IN A VESSEL. USE AS NEEDED; IN
WINTER IT WILL KEEP BUT IN SUMMER IT WILL LAST ONLY A FEW DAYS. COOKED
MEAT MAY BE TREATED LIKEWISE.</p>
<p>[11] TO KEEP COOKED SIDES OF PORK OR BEEF OR TENDERLOINS
   <em>CALLUM PORCINUM VEL BUBULUM ET UNGUELLÆ COCTÆ UT DIU DURENT</em></p>
<p>PLACE THEM IN A PICKLE OF MUSTARD, VINEGAR, SALT AND HONEY, COVERING
MEAT ENTIRELY, AND WHEN READY TO USE YOU&#39;LL BE SURPRISED.</p>
<pre><code>V. Method still popular today for pickling raw meats.
The originals treat of cooked meats (Tor. _nucula
elixa_; G.-V. _unguellæ coctæ_; Tac. _nucella cocta_).
Dispensing with the honey, we use more spices, whole
pepper, cloves, bay leaves, also onions and root
vegetables. Sometimes a little sugar and wine is added
to this preparation which the French call _marinade_ and
the Germans _Sauerbraten-Einlage_.</code></pre><h4 id="viii">VIII.</h4>
<p>[12] TO MAKE SALT MEAT SWEET
   <em>UT CARNEM SALSAM DULCEM FACIAS</em></p>
<p>YOU CAN MAKE SALT MEATS SWEET BY FIRST BOILING THEM IN MILK AND THEN
FINISHING THEM IN WATER.</p>
<pre><code>V. Method still in practice today. Salt mackerel, finnan
haddie, etc., are parboiled in milk prior to being
boiled in water or broiled or fried.</code></pre><h4 id="ix">IX.</h4>
<p>[13] TO KEEP FRIED FISH
   <em>UT PISCES FRICTI DIU DURENT</em></p>
<p>IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY ARE FRIED POUR HOT VINEGAR OVER THEM.</p>
<pre><code>Dann. Exactly as we today with fried herring and river
lamprey.</code></pre><p>[14] TO KEEP OYSTERS
   <em>OSTREA UT DIU DURENT</em></p>
<p>FUMIGATE A VINEGAR BARREL WITH PITCH [1], WASH IT OUT WITH VINEGAR AND
STACK THE OYSTERS IN IT [2]</p>
<pre><code>[1] Tor. _vas ascernum_, corrected on margin, _ab
aceto_. List. _vas ab aceto_, which is correct. G.-V.
_lavas ab aceto_; V. the oysters? unthinkable! Besides
it would do no good.

[2] Goll. Take oysters out of the shell, place in
vinegar barrel, sprinkle with laurel berries, fine salt,
close tight. V. Goll&#39;s authority for this version is
not found in our originals.

V. There is no way to keep live oysters fresh except in
their natural habitat—salt water. Today we pack them in
barrels, feed them with oatmeal, put weights on them—of
no avail. The only way English oysters could have
arrived fresh in Imperial Rome was in specially
constructed bottoms of the galleys.</code></pre><h4 id="x">X.</h4>
<p>[15] MAKING A LITTLE LASER GO A LONG WAY
   <em>UT NUCIA _[1]</em> LASERIS TOTO TEMPORE UTARIS_</p>
<p>PUT THE LASER [2] IN A SPACIOUS GLASS VESSEL; IMMERSE ABOUT 20 PINE
KERNELS [pignolia nuts]</p>
<p>IF YOU NEED LASER FLAVOR, TAKE SOME NUTS, CRUSH THEM; THEY WILL IMPART
TO YOUR DISH AN ADMIRABLE FLAVOR. REPLACE THE USED NUTS WITH A LIKE
NUMBER OF FRESH ONES [3]</p>
<pre><code>[1] List. and G.-V. _uncia_—ounce. Making an ounce of
laser go a long way. Tor. _nucea_; Tac. _nucia_. Lister,
fond of hair-splitting, is irreconcilably opposed to
Tor., and berates Caspar Barthius for defending Tor.
List. _Quam futilis sit in multis labor C. Barthii ut
menda Torini passim sustineat, vel ex hoc loco
intelligere licet: Et enim lege modo uncia pro nucea cum
Humelbergio, &amp; ista omnia glossemata vana sunt._

V. both readings, _uncia_ or _nucia_ are permissible,
and make very little difference. We side with Tor. and
Tac. because it takes more than an ounce of laser to
carry out this experiment.

[2] _Laser_, _laserpitium_, cf. dictionary.

[3] V. This article illustrates how sparingly the
ancients used the strong and pungent laser flavor [by
some believed to be _asa foetida_] because it was very
expensive, but principally because the Roman cooks
worked economically and knew how to treat spices and
flavors judiciously. This article alone should disperse
for all time all stories of ancient Rome&#39;s extravagance
in flavoring and seasoning dishes. It reminds of the
methods used by European cooks to get the utmost use out
of the expensive vanilla bean: they bury the bean in a
can of powdered sugar. They will use the sugar only
which has soon acquired a delicate vanilla perfume, and
will replace the used sugar by a fresh supply. This is
by far a superior method to using the often rank and
adulterated &quot;vanilla extract&quot; readily bottled. It is
more gastronomical and more economical. Most commercial
extracts are synthetic, some injurious. To believe that
any of them impart to the dishes the true flavor desired
is of course ridiculous. The enormous consumption of
such extracts however, is characteristic of our
industrialized barbarism which is so utterly indifferent
to the fine points in food. Today it is indeed hard for
the public to obtain a real vanilla bean.

and 385.</code></pre><h4 id="xi">XI.</h4>
<p>[16] TO MAKE HONEY CAKES LAST

<p>HOW BAD HONEY MAY BE TURNED INTO A SALEABLE ARTICLE IS TO MIX ONE PART
OF THE SPOILED HONEY WITH TWO PARTS OF GOOD HONEY.</p>
<pre><code>List. _indigna fraus_! V. We all agree with Lister that
this is contemptible business. This casts another light
on the ancients&#39; methods of food adulteration.</code></pre><p>[18] TO TEST SPOILED HONEY

<p>[19] TO KEEP GRAPES
   <em>UVÆ UT DIU SERVENTUR</em></p>
<p>TAKE PERFECT GRAPES FROM THE VINES, PLACE THEM IN A VESSEL AND POUR
RAIN WATER OVER THEM THAT HAS BEEN BOILED DOWN ONE THIRD OF ITS
VOLUME. THE VESSEL MUST BE PITCHED AND SEALED WITH PLASTER, AND MUST
BE KEPT IN A COOL PLACE TO WHICH THE SUN HAS NO ACCESS. TREATED IN
THIS MANNER, THE GRAPES WILL BE FRESH WHENEVER YOU NEED THEM. YOU CAN
ALSO SERVE THIS WATER AS HONEY MEAD TO THE SICK.</p>
<p>ALSO, IF YOU COVER THE GRAPES WITH BARLEY [bran] YOU WILL FIND THEM

of sorrel, monk&#39;s rhubarb, dock. Tor. explaining at
length: _conditura Rumicis quod lapathon Græci, Latini
Lapam quoque dicunt_.

V. Tor. is correct, or nearly so. Turnips, in the first
place, are not in need of any special method of
preservation. They keep very well in a cool,
well-ventilated place; in fact they would hardly keep
very long if treated in the above manner. These
directions are better applied to vegetables like dock or
monk&#39;s rhubarb. Lister, taking Humelbergii word for it,
accepts &quot;turnips&quot; as the only truth; but he has little
occasion to assail Torinus as he does: _Torinus lapam
legit, &amp; nullibi temeritatem suam atque inscientiam

_garum_ proper. Thus prepared it might turn out to be a

l., which is impossible in the sense of the word,
frying. Either &quot;frying&quot; here stands for cooking,

means &quot;cooked.&quot; If one were not sure of either word, the
nature of the subject would leave no room for any doubt.
Cf. note 1 to Nos. 115-121.

[2] We may find a reason for the combination of these
last three distinctly different formulæ into one article
in the following explanation. It is possible that these
dishes were served together as one course, even on one
platter, thus constituting a single dish, as it were.
Such a dish would strongly resemble platters of
&quot;_fritures_&quot; and &quot;_fritto misto_&quot; (mixed fried foods)
esteemed in France and Italy. We, too, have &quot;Shore
Dinners&quot; and other &quot;Combination Platters&quot; with lobster,
crabs, scallops, shrimps, mushrooms, tomatoes—each
article prepared separately, but when served together
will form an integral part of ONE dish.

The above formulæ, though somewhat incomplete, are good
and gastronomically correct. A combination of these
_isicia_ such as we here suggest would be entirely
feasible and would in fact make a dish of great
refinement, taxing the magiric artist&#39;s skill to the
utmost. We would class them among the _entremets chauds_

The suggestion of oil is plausible because of the lack
of fat in chicken meat, but the quantity—1 lb.—is out
of question. Moreover, the binder would be lacking. This
is found in the Torinus rendering.

His _lolæ floris_ should read _lolii_—from
_lolium_—darnel rye grass or ray grass which was
supposed to have intoxicating qualities, injurious to
the eye sight.—Ovid and Plautus. The seeds of this
grass were supposed to possess narcotic properties but
recent researches have cast doubt upon this theory.

A little butter, fresh cream and eggs are the proper
ingredients for chicken forcemeat. Any kind of flour for
binding the forcemeat would cheapen the dish. Yet some
modern forcemeats (sausage) contain as much as fifty
percent of some kind of meal. The most effective is that
of the soya bean which is not starchy.</code></pre><p>[51] CHICKEN BROTH ANOTHER STYLE

The reference by the original to &quot;which the Romans call

This is an interesting suggestion, and it could be
elaborated on to say that the entire Apicius is NOT of
Roman origin. But why should the Greeks who in their
balmy days were so far in advance of Rome in culinary
matters go there for such information?

It is more likely that this reference to Rome comes from
the Italian provinces or the colonies, regions which
naturally would look to Rome for guidance in such

Celery and Leeks. The ancient method is entirely
rational because the mineral salts of the vegetables are
preserved and utilized (invariably observed by Apicius)
which today are often wasted by inexperienced cooks who
discard these precious elements with the water in which
vegetables are boiled.</code></pre><h4 id="iii-2">III.</h4>
<p>[72] ASPARAGUS
   <em>ASPARAGOS</em></p>
<p>ASPARAGUS [Tor. IN ORDER TO HAVE IT MOST AGREEABLE TO THE PALATE] MUST
BE [peeled, washed and] DRIED [1] AND IMMERSED IN BOILING WATER
BACKWARDS [2] [3].</p>
<pre><code>[1] V. Must be dried before boiling because the cold
water clinging to the stalks is likely to chill the
boiling water too much in which the asparagus is to be
cooked. Apicius here reveals himself as the consummate
cook who is familiar with the finest detail of physical
and chemical changes which food undergoes at varying
temperatures.

The various editions all agree: _asparagos siccabis_;
Schuch, however, says: &quot;For the insane _siccabis_ I
substitute _siciabis_, _isiciabis_, prepare with _sicio_
[?] and cook.&quot; He even goes on to interpret it _cucabis_
from the Greek _kouki_, cocoanut milk, and infers that
the asparagus was first cooked in cocoanut milk and then
put back into water, a method we are tempted to
pronounce insane.

[2] V. Backwards! G.-V. _rursum in calidam_; Tac.
_rursus in aquam calidam_; Tor. _ac rursus ..._

This word has caused us some reflection, but the ensuing
discovery made it worth while. _Rursus_ has escaped the
attention of the other commentators. In this case
_rursus_ means backwards, being a contraction from
_revorsum_, h.e. _reversum_. The word is important
enough to be observed.

Apicius evidently has the right way of cooking the fine
asparagus. The stalks, after being peeled and washed
must be bunched together and tied according to sizes,
and the bunches must be set into the boiling water
&quot;backwards,&quot; that is, they must stand upright with the
heads protruding from the water. The heads will be made
tender above the water line by rising steam and will be
done simultaneously with the harder parts of the stalks.
We admit, we have never seen a modern cook observe this
method. They usually boil the tender heads to death
while the lower stalks are still hard.

Though this formula is incomplete (it fails to state the
sauce to be served, also that the asparagus must be
peeled and bunched, that the water must contain salt,
etc.) it is one of the neatest formulæ in Apicius. It is
amusing to note how the author herein unconsciously
reveals what a poor litérateur but what a fine cook he
is. This is characteristic of most good practitioners.
One may perfectly master the vast subject of cookery,
yet one may not be able to give a definition of even a
single term, let alone the ability to exactly describe
one of the many processes of cookery. Real poets often
are in the same predicament; none of them ever explained
the art satisfactorily.

[3] G.-V. add to the formula _callosiores reddes_—give
back [eliminate] the harder ones. This sentence belongs
to the next article. And Torinus, similar to
Humelbergius, renders this sentence _ut reddas ad gustum
calliores_—to render the harder ones palatable—the
squash and pumpkin namely—and we are inclined to agree
with him.</code></pre><h4 id="iv-2">IV.</h4>

<pre><code>Very sensible way of using cabbage stalks that are
usually thrown away. Note the almost scientific
procedure: the stalks are separated from the leaves,
split to facilitate cooking; they are cooked separately
because they require more time than the tender greens.

Our present method appears barbarous in comparison. We
quarter the cabbage head, and either boil it or steam
it. As a result either the tender leaves are cooked to
death or the stems are still hard. The overcooked parts
are not palatable, the underdone ones indigestible. Such
being the case, our boiled cabbage is a complete loss,
unless prepared the Apician way.</code></pre><p>[89] ANOTHER WAY

in the above formula.

The Græco-Latin word for cow-parsnip is _spondylium_,
_sphondylium_, _spondylion_. It is almost certain that
the preceding parsnips formulæ are in the right place
here. They are in direct line with the other vegetables
here treated—the shellfish—_spondylus_—would be out
of place in this chapter, Book III, The Gardener. All
the recipes, with the exception of the above, fit a
vegetable like parsnips. Even Lister&#39;s and Humelberg&#39;s

_spongioli_—mushrooms—could be questioned under this

It is barely possible that this entire series of

Quoting from &quot;A Collection of Receipts in Cookery,

&quot;Panada for a Sick or Weak Stomach. Put the crumbs of a
Penny White-Loaf grated into a Quart of cold Water, set
both on the Fire together with a blade of Mace: When
&#39;tis boil&#39;d smooth, take it off the fire and put in a
bit of Lemon-peel, the juice of a Lemon, a glass of Sack
[Spanish Wine] and Sugar to your Taste. This is very
Nourishing and never offends the Stomach. Some season
with butter and Sugar, adding Currants which on some
occasions are proper; but the first is the most grateful
and innocent.&quot;

Mrs. Glasse, a quarter century later, in her famous book
[The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, London, 1747,
1st ed.] omits the wine, but Mrs. Mason, at about the
same time, insists on having it with panada.

The imaginary or real relation between the sciences of
cookery and medicine is illustrated here.</code></pre><h4 id="ii-3">II.</h4>

This again illustrates the laconic style of the ancient

was placed on the service platter and that the juices
remaining in the sauce pan were tied with one or two egg
yolks, diluted with cream, or wine, or _court bouillon_,
strained and poured over the fish at the moment of
serving. This is perhaps the best method of preparing

apua_—a dish of anchovies (or smelts) without
anchovies. Tor. formula bears the title _patina de
apua_, and his article opens with the following
sentence: _patin de abua sive apua sic facies_. He is
therefore quite emphatic that the dish is to be made
with the _abua_ or _apua_ (an anchovy) and not without
_apua_, as List. has it. Lan. calls the dish: P. _de
apabadiade_, not identified.

[2] Tor. _impones ad uaporem ut cum ouis meare
possint_—warning, get along with the eggs, i.e. beware
of boiling them for they will curdle, and the experiment
is hopelessly lost. List. however, reads _meare possint_
thus: _bullire p._—boil (!) It is quite plain that Tor.
has the correct formula.

[3] _et ex esu nemo agnoscet quid manducet._ Dann.
renders this sentence thus: &quot;Nobody can value this dish
unless he has partaken of it himself.&quot; He is too
lenient. We would rather translate it literally as we
did above, or say broadly, &quot;And nobody will be any the
wiser.&quot; List. dwells at length upon this sentence; his
erudite commentary upon the _cena dubia_, the doubtful
meal, will be found under the heading of _cena_ in our
vocabulary. List. pp. 126-7. List. undoubtedly made the
mistake of reading _sine_ for _sive_. He therefore
omitted the _apua_ from his formula. The above boastful
sentence may have induced him to do so.

The above is a fish forcemeat, now seldom used as an
integral dish, but still popular as a dressing for fish

appears as tunny. The ancients called the sturgeon
_acipenser_; but this name was gradually changed into

_tursio_ (cf. _styrio_ in the vocabulary). The fish in

The above is an excellent way of making fish balls, it
being taken for granted, of course, that the salt fish
be thoroughly soaked and cooked in milk before shaping
into balls. The many spices should be used very
moderately, some to be omitted entirely. We read between
the lines of the old formula that the _Tursio_ had a
long journey from Pontus to Rome; fish however dry
acquires a notorious flavor upon such journeys which
must be offset by herbs and spices.

It is quite possible that the ancients made a
_réduction_ of the herbs and spices mentioned in this
formula; in fact, the presence of vinegar leads us to
believe this, in which case this formula would be
nothing but a very modern sauce. The herbs and spices in
a _réduction_ are crushed and boiled down in vinegar and
wine, and strained off, they leave their finest flavor
in the sauce.</code></pre><p>[146] VEGETABLE DINNER

PEPPER, LOVAGE, CORIANDER, SATURY, ONION WITH WINE, BROTH, VINEGAR AND

ANY KIND OF VEGETABLE [2] MAY BE PREPARED IN THE ABOVE MANNER, IF YOU
WISH.</p>
<pre><code>[1] Wanting in Tac. and Tor. G.-V. _patellam ex
holisatro_.

[2] It is worth noting that Tor. and Tac. omit this
recipe entirely and that Tor. concludes the preceding
formula with the last sentence of the above formula,
except for the difference in one word. Tor. _et de
quacunque libra_ [List. _et al._ _herba_] _si volueris
facies ut demonstratum est suprà_. This might mean that
it is optional (in the preceding formula) to shape the
fish into one pound loaves instead of the small fish
balls, which is often done in the case of forcemeats, as
in veal, beef, ham loaves, or fish pie.

We are inclined to accept the reading of Torinus, for
the above way of preparing &quot;any kind of vegetables or
herbs&quot; is somewhat farfetched. Furthermore, the
vegetable dish would more properly belong in Book III.

Just another example of where readings by various
editors are different because of the interpretations of
one word. In this case one group reads _libra_ whereas
the other reads _herba_.</code></pre><p>[147] A DISH OF SARDINES
    <em>PATELLA DE APUA</em> [1]</p>
<p>SARDINE LOAF (OR OMELETTE) IS MADE IN THIS MANNER [2] CLEAN THE
SARDINES [of skin and bones]; BREAK [and beat] EGGS AND MIX WITH [half
of the] FISH [3]; ADD TO THIS SOME STOCK, WINE AND OIL, AND FINISH
[the composition] BY HEATING IT. WHEN DONE TO A POINT, ADD [the
remaining part of the] SARDINES TO IT, LET IT STAND A WHILE [over a
slow fire to congeal] CAREFULLY TURN OVER [dish it up] MASK WITH A
WARM [4] WINE SAUCE, SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.</p>
<pre><code>[1] G.-V. _Patina de apua fricta_—same as _aphya_,
fried fresh small fish of the kind of anchovies,
sardines, sprats.

In experimenting with this formula we would advise to
use salt and oil judiciously if any at all. We have no
knowledge of the ancient _apua fricta_ other than our
making of modern sardines which is to fry them in oil as
quickly as possible after the fish has left the water,
for its meat is very delicate. For an omelette, our
modern sardines, including kippered smelts, sprotten,
and similar smoked and processed fish, contain
sufficient salt and fat to season the eggs of an
omelette.

[2] Tor. Sentence wanting in other texts.

[3] Tor. _cum aqua_; List., G.-V. _cum apua_. Perhaps a
typographical error in Tor. A little water is used to
dilute the eggs of an omelette, but Apicius already
prescribes sufficient liquids (stock or brine, wine) for
that purpose.

[4] Tor. _et in calore œnogarum perfundes_; List.,
G.-V. _ut coloret_—to keep the omelette in the pan long
enough to give it &quot;color.&quot; We prefer the Torinus version
because an omelette should have no or very little color
from the fire (the eggs thus browned are indigestible)
and because hot _œnogarum_ (wine-fish sauce, not in
List.) is accompanying this dish, to give additional
savour and a finishing touch.</code></pre><p>[148] FINE RAGOUT OF BRAINS AND BACON

<pre><code>[1] G.-V. _lagitis_; Tor. _laridis_ and _largitis_; Vat.
Ms. _lagatis_; List. _pro lagitis ... legendum
Lacertis_. The _lacertus_, according to List., is a much
esteemed salt fish; not identified. List. _et al._ seem
to be mistaken in their reading of _lacertis_ for
_laridis_. This work stands for salt pork, from
_laridum_ and _lardum_ (French, _lard_; the English
_lard_ is applied to the rendered fat of pork in
general). Cf. notes to ℞ No. 41.

[2] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.

[3] _oua dura_; Sch. _o. dua_—two eggs.

[4] This formula would be intelligible and even
gastronomically correct were it not for this word
&quot;fish.&quot; However, we cannot accept Lister&#39;s reading
_lacertis_. We prefer the reading, _laridis_, bacon. The
French have another term for this—_petits salés_. Both
this and the Torinus term are in the plural. They are
simply small strips of bacon to which Torinus again
refers in the above formula, _salsum, coctum in media
pones_—put the bacon, when done, in the center (of the
dish). Regarding _salsum_ also see note to ℞ No. 41.

The above dish resembles _ragoût fin en coquille_, a
popular Continental dish, although its principal
ingredients are sweetbreads instead of brains.</code></pre><p>[149] BROILED MULLET

[4] To glaze the pork, no doubt; reminding us of our own
use of sugar to glaze ham or bacon, and of the molasses
added to pork (and beans).

[5] G.-V. _coronam bubulam_. In experimenting with this
formula omit salt completely. Instead of honey we have
also added maple syrup once. To make this a perfect
luncheon dish a starch is wanting; we have therefore
added sliced raw potatoes and cooked with the rest, to
make it a balanced meal, by way of improving upon
Lucretius. Since the ancients had no potatoes we have,
on a different occasion, created another version by
added sliced dasheens (_colocasia_, cf. ℞ Nos. 74,
216, 244, 322). It is surprising that the ancients who
used the _colocasium_ extensively did not combine it
with the above dish.</code></pre><p>[153] STEWED LACERTUS FISH

<pre><code>[1] Ex List. wanting in Tor. G.-V. _P. de lagitis_; cf.
note to ℞ No. 148.

[2] Remembering that List. reads _lagitis_ for
_lacertis_, this formula appears to be an antique
&quot;Scrambled Eggs and Bacon.&quot; Cf. notes to ℞ Nos. 42,
148-150.

[3] _Oenogarum_, cf. ℞ No. 147, the Sardine Omelette.

[4] To cook the eggs as described above would be
disastrous. The fish, if such was used, was probably
first poached in the broth, wine and oil, and when done,
removed from the pan. The _fond_, or remaining juice or
gravy, was subsequently tied with the egg yolks, and
this sauce was strained over the fish dressed on the
service platter, the _œnogarum_ sparingly sprinkled
over the finished dish. This would closely resemble our
modern _au vin blanc_ fish dishes; the _œnogarum_
taking the place of our meat glacé.

Another interpretation of this vexatious formula is that
if fish was used, the cooked fish was incorporated with
the raw beaten eggs which were then scrambled in the
pan. In that event this formula resembles closely the
sardine omelette.</code></pre><p>[154] A FISH STEW

[3] _testiculi caponum_; the capon has no _testiculi_,
these organs having been removed by an operation when
the cock is young. This operation is said to have been
first performed by a Roman surgeon with the intention of
beating the _Lex Fannia_, or Fannian law, sponsored by a
fanatic named Fannius. It prohibited among other
restrictions the serving of any fowl at any time or
repast except a hen, and this hen was not to be
fattened. Note the cunning of the law: The useful hen
and her unlaid eggs could be sacrificed while the
unproductive rooster was allowed to thrive to no
purpose, immune from the butcher&#39;s block. This set the
shrewd surgeon to thinking; he transformed a rooster
into a capon by his surgical trick. The emasculated bird
grew fat without his owner committing any infraction of
the Roman law against fattening chickens. Of course the
capon, being neither hen nor rooster, was perfectly safe
to eat, for he was within the law. Thus he became a huge
success as an ancient &quot;bootleg&quot; chicken.

[2] At this late point Apicius commences to use the term
_coctura_ which does not designate any particular
ingredient but rather stands for a certain process of
cookery, depending upon the ingredients used in the
dish. We would here interpret it as the frying of the
leeks in oil, etc. In another instance _coctura_ may
mean our modern _réduction_.

[3] The fruit to be used here has not been
satisfactorily identified. The texts have _citrium_ and
_citrum_—a sweet squash or cucumber—perhaps even a
melon, but not the citron, the _mala citrea_ as read by
List. This specimen is hard to identify because of the
many varieties in the cucumber, squash and the citrus
families. _Citrus_, as a matter of fact, is but a
corruption of _cedrus_, the cedar tree.

We are not sure whether this fruit is to be stuffed with
the ragout and then baked, as is often the custom to do
with such shells; the texts prescribes distinctly to
hollow out the fruit.

The title, implying a &quot;sweet dish&quot; is obviously wrong.

It may be remarked here that Apicius makes no mention of
that marvelous citrus fruit, the lemon, nor of the
orange, both of which are indispensable to modern

The above title has led to the belief that the ancients
made pies, etc., of roses, an idea that was much
ridiculed in England after the publication of Lister&#39;s

We concur with Schuch&#39;s interpretation that rosy apples
were used, remembering, however, that the fruit of the
rose tree, the hip, dog-briar, eglantine is also made
into dainty confections on the Continent today. It is
therefore entirely possible that this recipe calls for
the fruit of the rose tree.</code></pre><h4 id="iv-3">IV.</h4>

<pre><code>[1] Lister praises the early green fruit and the use
thereof, and, as a physician, recommends imitation of
the above as follows: _In aliis plurimis locis hujus
fructus mentio fit; ususque mirabilis fuit; &amp; certe
propter salubritatem, nostram imitationem meretur._

[2] We do not like the &quot;pepper&quot; in this connection and
we venture to suggest that in this case the term
probably stands for some other kind of aromatic seed
less pungent than the grain known to us as &quot;pepper&quot; and
one more acceptable to the fine flavor of fruit, namely
pimiento, allspice for instance, or clove, or nutmeg, or
a mixture of these. &quot;Pepper&quot; formerly was a generic term
for all of these spices but was gradually confined to
the grain pepper of black and white varieties.

[3] We concur with Lister&#39;s idea of the use of early
fruits. The use of early and unripe fruit for this and
similar purposes is excellent. The above formula is a
good example of our own &quot;spiced&quot; peaches, pears, etc.,
usually taken as a relish. Of course, we use sugar
instead of honey for sweetening, and brandy instead of
wine; but the underlying principles are alike.

This is a good illustration of and speaks well for the
economy and the ingenuity of the ancients.</code></pre><p><em>EXPLICIT APICII PANDECTER, LIBER QUARTUS</em> [Tac.]</p>

[2] _Puls_—formerly a simple porridge of various kinds
of cereals or legumes, eaten by the Romans before bread
came into use. _Puls_ remained in use after the
introduction of bread only as a food of the poor. It was
also used at sacrifices. The _pultes_ and _pulticulæ_
given by Apicius are illustrations of the ever-present
desire to improve—to glorify, as it were, a thing which
once was or still is of vital importance in the daily
life of humans. The _nouveaux-riches_ of the ancient and
the modern world cannot find it easy to separate
themselves from their traditions nor are they wont to
put up with their plainness, hence the fancy trimmings.
The development of the American pie is a curious analogy
in this respect. We see in this the intricate working of
human culture, its eternal strife for perfection. And
perfection is synonymous with decay. The fare of the
Carthusian monks, professed, stern vegetarians,
underwent the same tortuous evolution.

[3] Named for Didius Julianus, the emperor who was a
vegetarian. Of course, his majesty could not live on a
plain porridge, hence the Apician artistry. The _pultes_
were popular with the many professed vegetarians though
the obliging cooks mixed finely ground meat in this and
other porridges.

Our various cream soups and legume purées—those most
salubrious creations of modern cookery are no doubt
lineal descendants from the Apician _pultes_. They are
so scarce comparatively because they require all the
ingenuity and resourcefulness of a gifted cook to be
perfect.

[4] If Vitellius never invented any other dish than this
one, his gluttony was overrated. As a gastronomer he may
be safely relegated to the vast multitude of ill-advised
people whose craving for carbohydrates (which is perhaps
pathological) causes them to accumulate a surplus of
fat. This was fatal to Vitellius and his faithful court
baker who is said to have stuck to his master to the
last. The poor emperor&#39;s _embonpoint_ proved cumbersome
when he fled the infuriated mob. Had he been leaner he

[3] These apparently outlandish ways of cooking beans
compel us to draw a modern parallel in a cookery book,
specializing in Jewish dishes. To prove that Apicius is
not dead &quot;by a long shot,&quot; we shall quote from Wolf,
Rebekka: Kochbuch für Israelitische Frauen, Frankfurt,
1896, 11th edition. As a matter of fact, Rebekka Wolf is
outdoing Apicius in strangeness—a case of _Apicium in
ipso Apicio_, as Lister sarcastically remarks of
Torinus.

Rebekka Wolf: ℞ No. 211—wash and boil the young
beans in fat _bouillon_ (Apicius: _oleum et liquamen_)
adding a handful of chopped pepperwort (A.: _piper,
ligusticum_) and later chopped parsley (A.:
_petroselinum_) some sugar (A.: _mel pavo_—little
honey) and pepper. Beans later in the season are cooked
with potatoes. The young beans are tied with flour
dissolved in water, or with roux.

_Id. ibid._, ℞ No. 212, Beans Sweet-Sour. Boil in
water, fat, salt, add vinegar, sugar or syrup, &quot;English
aromatics&quot; and spices, lemon peel, and a little pepper;
bind with roux.

_Id. ibid._, ℞ No. 213, Cut Pickled Beans
(_Schneidebohnen_) prepare as ℞ No. 212, but if you
would have them more delicious, take instead of the roux
grated chocolate, sugar, cinnamon, lemon peel and lemon
juice, and some claret. If not sour enough, add vinegar,
but right here you must add more fat; you may lay on top
of this dish a bouquet of sliced apples.

_Id. ibid._, ℞ No. 214, Beans and Pears. Take cut and
pickled beans and prepare as above. To this add peeled
fresh pears, cut into quarters; then sugar, lemon peel
cut thin, cinnamon, &quot;English&quot; mixed spices, and at last
the roux, thinned with broth. This dish must be sweet
and very fat.

As for exotic combinations, Apicius surely survives
here, is even surpassed by this Jewish cookery book
where, no doubt, very ancient traditions have been
stored away.</code></pre><h4 id="vii-2">VII.</h4>

Old Apicius; hence it is not popular with the multitude.

[2] Tac., Tor. _excipies_; Hum. _legendum: ex rapis_.

[3] G.-V. _ut exbromari possint_; Tor. _expromi_; Hum.
_expromari_; all of which does not mean anything. To
cook the turnips so that they can be squeezed out
(_exprimo_, from _ex_ and _premo_) is the proper thing
to do from a culinary standpoint.

[4] The turnips are cooked half, the water removed, and
finished with the duck, as prescribed by Apicius. It is
really admirable to see how he handles these food
materials in order to remove any disagreeable flavor,
which may be the case both with the turnips (the small

The above recipe does not in the least indicate how to
treat smelly birds. Wrapping them in dough would vastly

[2] For inspection. G.-V. _levas_; Tor. _lavabis_, for
which there is no reason.

[3] Dann. and Goll., not knowing the colocasium or
dasheen have entirely erroneous versions of this
formula. The dasheen is well adapted for the stuffing of
fowl. Ordinarily the dasheen is boiled or steamed,
mashed, seasoned and then stuffed inside of a raw
chicken which is then roasted. Being very starchy, the
dasheen readily absorbs the fats and juices of the
roast, making a delicious dressing, akin in taste to a
combined potato and chestnut purée.

As the above chicken is cooked in _bouillon_ or water,
the dasheen may be used in a raw state for filling. We
have tried this method. Instead of confining the chicken
in a basket, we have tied it in a napkin and boiled
slowly until done. Serve cold, with the above dressing.</code></pre><p>[245] CHICKEN À LA VARUS [1]

sauce is lacking here. Cf. ℞ No. 245.

[3] The use of water to clarify the oil which is to
serve as a deep frying fat is an ingenious idea, little
practised today. It surely saves the fat or oil,
prevents premature burning or blackening by frequent
use, and gives a better tasting _friture_. The above
recipe is a mere fragment, but even this reveals the
extraordinary knowledge of culinary principles of
Apicius who reveals himself to us as a master of
well-understood principles of good cookery that are so
often ignored today. Cf. Note 5 to ℞ No. 497.

[4] The recipe fails to state that the chicken must be
breaded, or that the pieces of chicken be turned in
flour, etc., and fried in the oil.

[5] Another vital rule of deep fat frying not stated, or
rather stated in the language of the kitchen, namely
that the chicken must be crisp, dry, that is, not
saturated with oil, which of course every good fry cook
knows.

[6] With the cream sauce, prepared separately, spread on
the platter, with the fried chicken inside, or the sauce
in a separate dish, we have here a very close
resemblance to a very popular modern dish.

According to the invention of Marcus Apicius, pigs were
starved, and the hungry pigs were crammed with dry figs
and then suddenly given all the mead they wanted to
drink. The violent expansion of the figs in the
stomachs, or the fermentation caused acute indigestion
which killed the pigs. The livers were very much
enlarged, similar to the cramming of geese for the sake
of obtaining abnormally large livers. This latter method
prevailed in the Strassburg District until recently when
it was prohibited by law.</code></pre><p>[260] ANOTHER WAY

the professional bakers and confectioners supplied the

read in Columella and Pliny that the buds or shoots of
reeds were called by some &quot;bulbs,&quot; by others &quot;eyes,&quot;
and, remembering that these shoots make very desirable
vegetables when properly cooked, we feel inclined to
include these among the term &quot;bulbs.&quot; Platina also adds
the squill or sea onion to this category. Nonnus, p. 84,

&quot;EGYPTIAN BEAN&quot;) USE [2] PEPPER, CUMIN, RUE, HONEY, OR BROTH, AND A
LITTLE OIL; WHEN DONE BIND WITH ROUX [3] COLOCASIUM IS THE ROOT OF THE
EGYPTIAN BEAN WHICH IS USED EXCLUSIVELY [4].</p>
<pre><code>[1] Cf. notes to ℞ Nos. 74, 172, 216, 244; also the
copious explanations by Humelberg, fol. III.

[2] Tor. who is trying hard to explain the _colocasium_.
His name, &quot;Egyptian Bean&quot; may be due to the mealiness
and bean-like texture of the _colocasium_ tuber;
otherwise there is no resemblance to a bean, except,
perhaps, the seed pod which is not used for food. This
simile has led other commentators to believe that the
_colocasium_ in reality was a bean.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has in recent years
imported various specimens of that taro species
(belonging to the _colocasia_), and the plants are now
successfully being farmed in the southern parts of the
United States, with fair prospects of becoming an
important article of daily diet. The Department has
favored us repeatedly with samples of the taro, or
dasheen, (_Colocasium Antiquorum_) and we have made many
different experiments with this agreeable, delightful
and important &quot;new&quot; vegetable. It can be prepared in
every way like a potato, and possesses advantages over
the potato as far as value of nutrition, flavor, culture
and keeping qualities are concerned. As a commercial
article, it is not any more expensive than any good kind
of potato. It grows where the potato will not thrive,
and vice versa. It thus saves much in freight to parts
where the potato does not grow.

The ancient _colocasium_ is no doubt a close relative of
the modern dasheen or taro. The Apician _colocasium_ was
perhaps very similar to the ordinary Elephant-Ear,
_colocasium Antiquorum Schott_, often called _caladium
esculentum_, or _tanyah_, more recently called the
&quot;Dasheen&quot; which is a corruption of the French &quot;de
Chine&quot;—from China—indicating the supposed origin of
this variety of taro. The dasheen is a broad-leaved
member of the _arum_ family. The name dasheen originated
in the West Indies whence it was imported into the
United States around 1910, and the name is now
officially adopted.

Mark Catesby, in his Natural History of Carolina,
Florida and the Bahama Islands, London, 1781, describes
briefly under the name of _arum maximum Aegypticum_ a
plant which was doubtless one of the tanyahs or taros.
He says: &quot;This was a welcome improvement among the
negroes and was esteemed a blessing; they being
delighted with all their African food, particularly
this, which a great part of Africa subsists much on.&quot;

Torinus, groping for the right name, calls it variously
_colosium_, _coledium_, _coloesium_, till he finally
gets it right, _colocasium_.

[3] The root or tubers of this plant was used by the
ancients as a vegetable. They probably boiled and then
peeled and sliced the tubers, seasoning the pieces with
the above ingredients, heated them in bouillon stock and
thickened the gravy in the usual way. Since the tuber is
very starchy, little roux is required for binding.

proportions. A supper of the younger Pliny consisted of
a head of lettuce, three snails, two eggs, a barley

the eggs of game birds, and he comes to the conclusion
that game birds themselves are meant to be used in this
formula, as no reference to &quot;eggs&quot; is made.

There can be no doubt but what this formula deals with
the preparation of sheep; Torinus says expressly:
_oviferum, hoc est, carnem ovis sylvestris_—the meat of
sheep from the woods, mountain sheep. _Ferum_ is &quot;wild,&quot;
&quot;game,&quot; but it also means &quot;pregnant.&quot; For this double
sense the formula may be interpreted as dealing with
either wild sheep, or with pregnant sheep, or, more
probably, with unborn baby lamb, which in antiquity as
today is often killed principally for its skin.

appears to be merely an elaborate Roman ancestor of our

<p>&quot;The Porker&#39;s Last Will and Testament&quot;
    by Petrus Lambecius</p>
<pre><code>(V. Barnab. Brissonium de Formulis lib. VII, p. 677)
[ex Lister, 1705, p. 196; Lister, 1709, p. 236].

&quot;I, M. Grunter Corocotta Porker, do hereby make my last
will and testament. Incapable of writing in my own hand,
I have dictated what is to be set down:

&quot;The Chief Cook sayeth: &#39;Come here, you—who has upset
this house, you nuissance, you porker! I&#39;ll deprive you
of your life this day!&#39;

&quot;Corocotta Porker sayeth: &#39;What, perchance, have I done?
In what way, please, have I sinned? Have I with my feet
perhaps smashed your crockery? I beg of you, Mr. Cook, I
entreat you, if such be the case, kindly grant the
supplicant a reprieve.&#39;

&quot;The Chief Cook sayeth: &#39;Go over there, boy! Fetch me
from the kitchen that slaughtering-knife. I&#39;m just
itching to give this porker a blood-bath!&#39;

&quot;Mr. Porker, realizing that this is the season when
cabbage sprouts are abundant, and visualizing himself
potted and peppered, and furthermore seeing that death
is inevitable, asks for time and begs of the cook
whether it was possible to make a will. This granted, he
calls out with a loud voice to his parents to save for
them the food that was to have been his own in the
future, to wit:

&quot;To my father, Mr. Genuine Bacon-Fat, appointed by me
in my last will I give and bequeath: thirty measures of
acorns; and to my mother, Mrs. Old-Timer Sow, appointed
by me in my last will, I give and bequeath: forty
measures of Spartan wheat; and to my sister, Cry-Baby,
appointed by me in my last will, whose wedding, alas! I
cannot attend, I give and bequeath: thirty measures of
barley; and of my nobler parts and property I give and
bequeath, to the cobbler: my bristles; to the brawlers,
my jaw-bones; to the deaf, my ears; to the shyster
lawyers, my tongue; to the cow-herds, my intestines; to
the sausage makers, my thighs; to the ladies, my
tenderloins; to the boys, my bladder; to the girls, my
little pig&#39;s tail; to the dancers, my muscles; to the
runners and hunters, my knuckles; to the hired man, my
hoofs; and to the cook—though not to be named—I give
and bequeath and transmit my belly and appendage which I
have dragged with me from the rotten oak bottoms to the
pig&#39;s sty, for him to tie around his neck and to hang
himself with.

&quot;I wish to erect a monument to myself, inscribed with
golden letters: &#39;M. Grunter Corocotta Porker lived
nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine years, and had he lived
another half year, a thousand years would have been
nearly completed.&#39;

&quot;I ask of you who love me best, you who live like me, I
ask you: will not my name remain to be eulogized in all
eternity? if you only will prepare my body properly and
flavor it well with good condiments, nuts, pepper and
honey!

&quot;My master and my relatives, all of you who have
witnessed this execution of my last will and testament,
you are requested to sign.

<p>Thus far the story by Petrus Lambecius. The fifth of the signatories of
the Porker&#39;s Testament is Celsinus; and since the other names are
fictitious it is quite possible that Lambecius had a special purpose in
pointing out the man for whom the dish, Porcellus Celsinianus,—Suckling
Pig à la Celsinus—was named.</p>

above rich formula there is very little to remind us of
the gardener&#39;s style, excepting the last part of the
formula, enumerating a number of fresh vegetables. It is
unthinkable for any gourmet to incorporate these with
the rich dressing. The vegetables should be used as a
garnish for the finished roast. This leads us to believe
that the above is really two distinct formulæ, or that
the vegetables were intended for garniture.

[2] This extraordinary and rich dressing, perfectly
feasible and admirable when compared with our own
&quot;Toulouse,&quot; &quot;Financière,&quot; &quot;Chipolata,&quot; can be palatable
only when each component part is cooked separately
before being put into the pig. The eggs must be whipped
and diluted with broth and poured over the filling to
serve as binder. The pig must be parboiled before
filling, and the final cooking or roasting must be done
very slowly and carefully—procedure not stated by the
original which it takes for granted.</code></pre><p>[379] COLD SAUCE FOR BOILED SUCKLING PIG

The ancients probably used the trimmings of hare and
other meat for this forcemeat, or meat loaf, either to
stuff the hare with, or to make a meal of the
preparation itself, as indicated above.

We also recall that the ancients had ingenious baking
moulds of metal in the shape of hares and other animals.
These moulds, no doubt, were used for baking or the
serving of preparations of this sort. The absence of
table forks and cutlery as is used today made such
preparations very appropriate and convenient in

Tor. Still, roasts have for ages been &quot;hung on chains

This forcemeat is supposed to be used for the stuffing
of the hare; it, being boned, is rolled up, the
forcemeat inside, the outside covered with caul or
paper, fastened with skewers. Danneil&#39;s interpretation
suggests the thought that the raw hare&#39;s meat is cut

may be, &quot;Salt Fish, without salt pork&quot; as salt fish is
frequently served with bacon.

[3] Dann. Crush the liver, which is probably correct. A
paste or forcemeat of the livers and fish were made.

[4] The addition of salt would be superfluous if the
liver of salt meat is used, excepting if the liver of
hare, etc., predominated.

[6] Such fish-shape moulds existed, made of bronze,
artistically finished, same as we possess them today;
such moulds were made in various styles and shapes. Cf.

[7] This is an attempt to make a &quot;fish&quot; of livers, not
so much with the intention to deceive as to utilize the
livers in an attractive way. A very nutritious dish and
a most ingenious device, requiring much skill.

This is another good example of Roman cookery, far from
being extravagant as it is reputed to be, it is
economical and clever, and shows ingenuity in the
utilization of good things which are often discarded as

preparations are given, is very confusing to the
uninitiated. We assume that most of these ingredients
were used to season the water in which to boil fish; or,
to make a _court-bouillon_, a fish-essence of the bones
and the trimmings of the fish, in which to poach the
sliced fish. The liquor thus gained was reduced and in
the moment of serving was bound with roux or with yolks,
and the fish was masked with this sauce. The exceptions
from this rule are, of course, in cases where the fish
was broiled or fried.</code></pre><p>[449] SAUCE FOR BROILED MURENA

[2] Note the position of lovage in this formula. Usually
it follows pepper. We have finally accounted for this
peculiarity. Torinus, throughout the original, treats
&quot;pepper&quot; and &quot;lovage&quot; as one spice, whereas we have kept
the two separate. He believed it to be a certain kind of
pepper—_piper Ligusticum_. _Piper_, as a matter of
fact, stands for pepper, and _Ligusticum_ is the herb,
Lovage, an umbelliferous plant, also called
_Levisticum_. The fact that the two words are here
separated plainly shows that Torinus has been in the
dark about this matter almost to the end.

One wonders why he did not change or correct this error
in the preceding books. His marginal errata prove that
his work was being printed as he wrote it, or furnished
copy therefor—namely in installments. Since the
printer&#39;s type was limited, each sheet was printed in
the complete edition, and the type was then used over
again for the next sheet.

<pre><code>THE EXCERPTS FROM APICIUS
BY VINIDARIUS
THE ILLUSTRIOUS MAN</code></pre><p><em>Apici Excerpta A Vinidario Viro Inlustri</em></p>
<p>FIFTH CENTURY</p>
<p>Vinidarius, a Goth, of noble birth or a scientist, living in Italy.
Vinithaharjis is the native name. Of his time and life very little is
known. It appears that he was a student of Apicius and that he made
certain excerpts from that book which are preserved in the uncial
codex of Salmasius, sæc. VIII, Paris, lat. 10318.</p>
<p>Vollmer in his Apicius commentary says that Salmasius and his
predecessors have accepted them as genuine. Schuch incorporated these
recipes in the Apicius text of his editions, in appropriate places, as
he thought. This course cannot be recommended, although the recipes
should form an integral part of any Apicius edition.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="m-ihm-who-faithfully-reprinted-the-excerpta-in-the-archiv-f-lat">M. Ihm, who faithfully reprinted the excerpta in the Archiv f. lat.</h4>
<p>Lex. XV, 64, ff. says distinctly: &quot;These excerpts have nothing to do
with the ten books of Apicius, even if some recipes resemble each
other ...&quot; and other researchers have expressed the same opinion.
Vollmer, however, does not share this view.</p>
<p>If I may be permitted to concur with Vollmer, I would say that the
excerpts are quite Apician in character, and that in a sense they fill
certain gaps in the Apicius text, although the language is strongly
vulgarized which may be readily expected to be the case in the age of
Vinidarius.</p>
<p>The recipes of Anthimus, written around A.D. 511 also confirm the
close relation existing between Vinidarius and Apicius. Anthimus was
the Greek physician to Theodoric I, (The Great), Frankish king living
in Italy. He was not acquainted with Apicius.</p>

for this choice; but there can be no doubt but what we
have here a formula for a vegetable purée or a pudding,
a genuine &quot;Chartreuse,&quot; such as were prepared in the
fancy moulds so popular in old Rome. The &quot;Chartreuse,&quot;
then, is not original with the vegetarian monks of the
monastery by that name, the Carthusians.</code></pre><h4 id="ii-10">II.</h4>

<pre><code>[1] It is interesting to note how the generic terms,
_salacaccabia_ and _caccabina_ have degenerated here. In
these formulas the terms have lost all resemblance to
the former meaning, the original &quot;salt meat boiled in a
pot.&quot; Such changes are very often observed in the
terminology of our modern kitchens, in every language.
They make the definition of terms and the classification
of subjects extremely difficult. They add much to the
confusion among cooks and guests in public dining places
and create misunderstandings that only an expert can
explain.

[2] This dish affords an opportunity for a decorative
scheme by the arrangement of the various vegetables and
meats in a pleasing and artistic manner, utilizing the
various colors and shapes of the bits of food as one
would use pieces of stone in a mosaic. Of course, such a
design can be appreciated only if the chartreuse is
served unmoulded, i.e. if the cook succeeds in
unmoulding it without damaging the structure.</code></pre><h4 id="iii-10">III.</h4>
<p>[471] BRAISED CUTLETS
    <em>OFELLAS GARATAS</em> [1]</p>
<p>PLACE THE MEAT IN A STEW PAN, ADD ONE POUND [2] OF BROTH, A LIKE
QUANTITY OF OIL, A TRIFLE OF HONEY, AND THUS BRAISE [3].</p>
<pre><code>[1] Derived from _garum_ or _œnogarum_, the wine
sauce. These are supposed to be meat balls or cutlets
prepared with garum, but the _garum_ is not mentioned in
the formula. This also illustrates the interesting
etymology of the word. It is not recognized in every-day
ancient language because it is a typical technical term,
the much complained-of _lingua culinaria_. We find,
therefore, that—at least in this instance—_garum_ no
longer stands for a sauce made from the fish, _garus_,
but that _garum_ has become a generic term for certain
kinds of sauces. Danneil renders _garatus_ with
_lasaratus_, which is clearly out of place.

[2] In this instance, and in several others, and also
according to Sueton. Cæs. fluids were weighed. What idea
could be more practical, useful and more &quot;modern&quot; than
this? Sheer commercial greed, stubbornness, indolence
have thus far made futile all efforts towards more
progressive methods in handling food stuffs,
particularly in the weighing of them and in selling them
by their weight. Present market methods are very
chaotic, and are kept purposely so to the detriment of
the buyer.

[3] The original: _et sic frigis_.—_Frigo_ is
equivalent to frying, drying, parching; the word here
has taken on a broader meaning, because the &quot;frying&quot;
process is clearly out of question here. It appears that
the terminology of _frigo_ and that of _asso_ in the
next formula, has not been clearly defined. As a matter
of fact, not many modern cooks today are able to give a
clear definition of such terms as frying, broiling,
roasting, braising, baking, which are thus subject to
various interpretations.</code></pre><h4 id="iv-9">IV.</h4>

[3] Dann. oil; G.-V. _melle_—_honey_. It is quite
common to use honey for glazing foods. Today we sprinkle

<pre><code>[1] The fish was probably broiled on the _craticula_
(see our illustration).

The nature of this sauce is not quite clear. If properly
handled, it might turn out to be a highly seasoned
mayonnaise, or a vinaigrette, depending on the mode of
manipulation; either would be suitable for fried or
broiled fish.</code></pre><h4 id="xi-4">XI.</h4>
<p>[479] FISH AND WINE SAUCE
    <em>PISCES ŒNOTEGANON</em> [1]</p>
<p>FRY THE FISH; CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, RUE, GREEN HERBS, DRY ONIONS, ADD
OIL [wine] BROTH AND SERVE.</p>
<pre><code>[1] Ihm and G.-V. _œnoteganon_; _inotogono_ and in
the Summary of Dishes _inotogonon_; Sch. _eleogaro_.
Rather an obscure term, owing to the diversity of
spelling. We would call it a dish stewed in or prepared
with wine, although wine is absent in the present
formula. However, it is given in XIII, which bears the
same name.

Dann. is obviously mistaken in styling this preparation
&quot;oil broth.&quot;</code></pre><h4 id="xii-4">XII.</h4>
<p>[480] [Cold Sauce for] SARDINES MAKE THUS:

<p>CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE SEED, ORIGANY, DRY ONIONS, HARD BOILED YOLKS,
VINEGAR, OIL; THIS MUST BE COMBINED INTO ONE [2] AND UNDERLAID.</p>
<pre><code>[1] A kind of small tunny, which, like our herring, used
to be pickled or salt, corresponding to the anchovy. A
&quot;sardine,&quot; from the island of Sardinia; _Sardus_, the
inhabitant of Sardinia.

[2] The absence of detailed instructions as to the
manipulation of the yolks, oil and vinegar is
regrettable; upon them depends the certainty or
uncertainty of whether the ancients had our modern
mayonnaise.</code></pre><h4 id="xiii-4">XIII.</h4>
<p>[481] FISH STEWED IN WINE
    <em>PISCES ŒNOTEGANON</em> [1]</p>
<p>RAW FISH ANY KIND YOU PREFER, WASH [prepare, cut into handy size]
ARRANGE IN A SAUCE PAN; ADD OIL, BROTH, VINEGAR, A BUNCH OF LEEKS AND
[fresh] CORIANDER, AND COOK: [Meanwhile] CRUSH PEPPER, ORIGANY, LOVAGE
WITH THE BUNCHES OF LEEKS AND CORIANDER WHICH YOU HAVE COOKED [with
the fish] AND POUR [this preparation] INTO THE SAUCE PAN. [When the
fish is done, retire it and arrange the pieces in the serving dish,
casserole, bowl or platter] BRING THE RESIDUE IN THE SAUCE PAN TO A
BOILING POINT, ALLOW IT TO REDUCE SLOWLY TO THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY
[Strain the sauce of the fish] SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.</p>
<pre><code>[1] Cf. note to XI. This _œnoteganon_ resembles the
_Bouillabaisse_, the famous Marseilles fish chowder. In
addition to the above manner it is flavored with
saffron. An excellent dish, especially with the
judicious addition of onions, parsley, a suspicion of
garlic and small sippets of toasted bread.</code></pre><h4 id="xiv-4">XIV.</h4>
<p>[482] MULLET STEWED WITH DILL MAKE THUS:
    <em>MULLOS ANETHATOS _[1]</em> SIC FACIES_</p>

SAUCE PAN, ADDING OIL, BROTH, WINE, BUNCHES OF LEEKS, [fresh]
CORIANDER, [fresh dill]; PLACE ON FIRE TO COOK. [Meanwhile] PUT PEPPER</p>
<p>IN THE MORTAR, POUND IT, ADD OIL, AND ONE PART OF VINEGAR AND RAISIN.
WINE TO TASTE. [This preparation] TRANSFER INTO A SAUCE PAN, PLACE ON
THE FIRE TO HEAT, TIE WITH ROUX, ADD TO THE FISH IN THE SAUCE PAN.
SPRINKLE WITH PEPPER AND SERVE.</p>
<pre><code>[1] From _anethus_—dill—which is omitted in formula.
Sch. _anecatos_, i.e. _submersos_, because the original
fails to state the dill in the formula. Such conjecture
is not justified.</code></pre><h4 id="xv-3">XV.</h4>
<p>[483] MULLET ANOTHER STYLE
    <em>ALITER MULLOS</em></p>
<p>SCRAPE, WASH, PLACE [the fish] IN A SAUCE PAN, ADD OIL, BROTH, WINE

FIRE TO COOK. CRUSH PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, MOISTEN WITH SOME OF THE
FISH&#39;S OWN LIQUOR [from the sauce pan] ADD RAISIN WINE TO TASTE, PUT
IT INTO A POT AND ON THE FIRE TO HEAT; TIE WITH ROUX AND PRESENTLY ADDSERVE.</p>
<pre><code>[1] It appears that the _patina_ mentioned in this and
in the foregoing formula is either a finely wrought
metal sauce pan or chafing dish, or a plainer _cumana_,
an earthenware casserole; either of which may be used
for service at the table.

It may be noticed how this manner of preparing fish has
a tendency to preserve all the savory flavors and juices
of the fish, a process in this respect both rational and
economical.</code></pre><h4 id="xvi-3">XVI.</h4>
<p>[484] MURENA [1], EEL [2] OR MULLET MAKE THUS:
    <em>MURENAM AUT ANGUILLAS VEL MULLOS SIC FACIES</em></p>
<p>CLEAN THE FISH AND CAREFULLY PLACE IN A SAUCE PAN. IN THE MORTAR PUT
PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, MINT, DRY ONIONS, CRUSH, MOISTEN WITH A SMALL
GLASS OF WINE, HALF OF THAT OF BROTH, AND OF HONEY ONE THIRD PART, AND
A MODERATE AMOUNT OF REDUCED MUST, SAY A SPOONFUL. IT IS NECESSARY
THAT THE FISH BE ENTIRELY COVERED BY THIS LIQUOR SO THAT THERE MAY BE
SUFFICIENT JUICE DURING THE COOKING.</p>
<pre><code>[1] The ancients considered the murena one of the finest
of fish; the best were brought from the straits of
Sicily. Rich Romans kept them alive in their fish ponds,
often large and elaborate marble basins called,
_piscina_, fattened the fish, kept it ready for use.
Pollio fattened murenas on human flesh, killing a slave
on the slightest provocation and throwing the body into
the fish pond; he would eat only the liver of such
murenas. This is the only case of such cruelty on
record, and it has often been cited and exaggerated.

[2] Perhaps the sea-eel, or conger, according to Dann.
Also very much esteemed. The witty Plautus names a cook
in one of his comedies &quot;Congrio,&quot; because the fellow was
&quot;slippery.&quot;</code></pre><h4 id="xvii-3">XVII.</h4>

[hard boiled] EGGS, MIX WELL TOGETHER [2] AND DRESS [the boiled
shellfish meat with it] AND SERVE.</p>
<pre><code>[1] Cf. Summary of Dishes.

[2] Another of Apicii hasty and laconic formulæ. No
indication as to how to use the ingredients named.
According to our notion of eating, there is only one
way: The shellfish is boiled in aromatic water, allowed
to cool off; the meat is then taken out of the shells;
the above named ingredients are combined in a manner of
a mayonnaise or a vinaigrette, although the necessary
oil is not mentioned here. The dressing is poured over
the shellfish meat, and the result is a sort of salad or
&quot;cocktail&quot; as we have today.</code></pre><h4 id="xviii-3">XVIII.</h4>
<p>[486] [Sauce] FOR BOILED FISH
    <em>IN PISCIBUS ELIXIS</em></p>

ADD PINE NUTS, FIGDATES [1] IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY, HONEY, VINEGAR,
BROTH, MUSTARD, MIX AND COMBINE PROPERLY AND BRING FORTH.</p>
<pre><code>[1] Dann. is undecided as to whether this is dates or
date wine; Goll. thinks it is mustard seed, which is not
so bad gastronomically; but the original leaves no room
for any doubt.</code></pre><h4 id="xix-3">XIX.</h4>
<p>[487] A DISH OF SOLE WITH EGGS
    <em>PATINA SOLEARUM EX OVIS</em></p>
<p>SCALE [skin] CLEAN [the soles], PLACE IN A [shallow] SAUCE PAN, ADD
BROTH, OIL [white] WINE, A BUNCH OF LEEKS AND CORIANDER SEED, PLACE ON

fact, the presence of honey would make it a sweet
preparation. We take it, the &quot;garnish&quot; contains the
necessary vinegar or other acids such as lemon juice,

guts, a more solid substance, such as pork forcemeat,
eggs, or cereals would be required to make an acceptable
filling for the casings of the kid. Furthermore sausage,

THEM WITH A STRING. THEREUPON MAKE THIS PREPARATION IN WHICH THEY ARE
COOKED: CONSISTING OF OIL, SALT, WATER [5], DILL AND HEADS OF LEEKS.</p>
<pre><code>[1] Cf. Summary of Dishes; term not identified, derived
from the Greek, meaning to drive away all stomach ills.

[2] We use juniper berries today instead of cumin.

[3] Cf. note to ℞ 496, XXVIII.

[4] Thrush and other game birds of such small size are
not emptied in the usual way: they are cooked with the
entrails, or, the intestines are taken out, seasoned,
sauté, and are either put back into the carcasses, or
are served separately on bread croutons. In this
instance, the necessary seasoning is introduced through
the throat, a most ingenious idea that can only occur to
Apicius.

[5] In other instances we have pointed out where a small
amount of water was used to clarify the oil used for
frying foods. The presence here of water leads us to
believe that the thrush were not &quot;cooked,&quot; i.e. &quot;boiled&quot;
but that they were fried in a generous amount of oil;
this would make the ancient process remarkably similar
to the present European way of preparing thrush or
fieldfare, or similar game birds.

<p>DESCRIPTION OF MANUSCRIPTS</p>
<p>I, 9TH CENTURY</p>
<p>New York, Library of the Academy of Medicine, until 1930 in
Cheltenham, Gloucester, Biblioth. Phillipps, 275, in the library of
Sir Thomas Phillipps, a codex ca. Ninth century, 4to, parchment, 275
pp., originally bound up with Phill. 386, which is said to have come
from the Benedictine Abbey of St. Ghislain, founded at the end of the
7th century in the diocese of Cambrai; partly in Continental, but
mostly in Anglo-Saxon minuscle of the 9th century, not unlike the
Anglo-Saxon minuscle of Fulda.</p>
<p>Title missing. Cf. Vollmer, Studien, pp. 5-6.</p>
<p>The writer who has hastily inspected the manuscript in 1931 is of the
opinion that three different hands wrote this book. Part of the index
is gone, too. The book commences with lib. VII of the index. Bound in
an 18th century French full leather binding. It was brought to America
by Dr. Margaret B. Wilson and presented to the library of the A. of M.
in 1931.</p>
<p>II, 9TH CENTURY</p>
<p>Rome, Vatican Library. Vat. Vrbinas, lat. 1146, Ninth century. 58
sheets, 2 blanks in the beginning and 2 at the end. Size 23.75 × 18.75
cm., heavy parchment, 20-21 lines to the page, not numbered. Sheet 1
R, illuminated by square panel in purple and gold letters (capit.
quadr.) INC̅P̅ || API || CÆ ||—Nothing else. Sheet 1 V—3 R the
title, EPIM e || LES LI || BER I, and the titles of Book I,
illuminated with columns, flowers and birds. Sheet 3 R between the
foot of the columns EXPLICIVNT CAPITVLA. Sheet 3 V a panel in purple
similar to sheet 1 R with inscription, INC̅P̅ || CONDITV̅ ||
PARADOXV̅. Sheet 4 R commences the text with the title, I, Conditum
Paradoxum. Captions, marginal figures and initials in red. The
captions are written in good uncials throughout, the first text words
usually in half uncials, continuing in an even and beautiful minuscle.
The Explicits and Incipits invariably in capitalis rustica. Sheet 58 V
end of text with EXPLICIT LIBER X.</p>
<p>Traube, Vollmer and others believe that this manuscript was written in
or in the vicinity of Tours in the 9th century.</p>
<p>III, 8TH CENTURY</p>
<p>Paris, lat. 10318. 8th century. Codex Salmasianus, pp. 196-203, Apici

<p>Oxford, Bodl. Add. B 110, 15th century, Italian, cf. H. Schenkl, Bibl.
Britann. I. p. 79 n. 384 and F. Madan, A Summary Catalogue of Western
Mss. in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, 1905, p. 660. Vollmer says that
this Ms. belonged to a son of Humelbergius, as proven by P. Lehmann.</p>
<p>XII, 14TH CENTURY</p>
<p>Cesena, bibl. municip., 14th century.</p>
<p>XIII</p>
<p>A manuscript in the library of the Sforza brothers at Pesaro which
burned in 1514, known only from the catalogue. Cf. A. Vernarecci, La
Libreria di Gio. Sforza in Archivio storico per le Marche e l&#39;Umbria,
III, 1886, 518, 790.</p>
<p>XIV</p>
<p>A manuscript used by Bonifaz Amerbach and Joh. Sichardus. Cf. P.
Lehman, Joh. Sichardus, Quellen und Untersuchungen, IV, 1, p. 204.</p>
<p>XV-XVI</p>
<p>The two manuscripts mentioned by Albanus Torinus, in his edition of
Apicius, Basel, 1541. In 1529 Torinus found an Apicius &quot;codex&quot; on the
island of Megalona (Maguellone) which he used for his edition of
Apicius. It is almost certain that this was not a very ancient
manuscript. The way Torinus speaks of it and of the (first) Venetian
printed edition in his <em>epistola dedicatoria</em> leaves even doubt as to
whether his authority was handwritten or printed. A first edition,
printed ca. 1483, may have well been a dilapidated copy such as
Torinus describes in 1529. Torinus admits taking some liberties with
the text and failed to understand some phrases of it. Despite this
fact, his text, from a culinary point of view seems to be more
authentic than the Humelbergius and Lister versions.</p>
<p>The other codex according to Torinus, was found in Transsylvania by
Io. Honterus of Coronea. This codex may have served as authority for
the first edition printed ca. 1483 by Bernardinus, of Venice. No other
mention is made of this codex anywhere, which according to Torinus,
was sent to Venice from Transsylvania. The text of the Editio
Princeps, by the way, is thoroughly unreliable.</p>
<p>XVII, 15TH CENTURY</p>
<p>Ms. Rome, Vatican Library, lat. 6803, 15th Century.</p>
<p>XVIII, 15TH CENTURY</p>
<p>Munich, lat. 756. Ex bibl. Petri Victorii 49. 15th century. This codex
is particularly valuable and important for the identification of the
Apicius text. Cf. Vollmer, Studien, pp. 10 <em>seq.</em></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF PRINTED EDITIONS</p>
<p>These summaries and descriptions of the known manuscript books and
printed editions of Apicius are presented with a desire to afford the
students a survey of the field treated in this volume, to illustrate
the interest that has existed throughout the past centuries in our
ancient book.</p>
<p>Copies of any Apicius edition and commentaries are scarce; famous
collectors pride themselves in owning one or several of them. Of the
well-known collections of cookery books the most outstanding perhaps
is that of Theodor Drexel, of Frankfurt on the Main, who owned nine
different editions of Apicius. The Drexel catalogue forms the basis of
a bibliography—Verzeichnis der Litteratur über Speise und Trank bis
zum Jahre 1887, bearbeitet von Carl Georg, Hannover, 1888, describing
some 1700 works.</p>
<p>The Drexel collection, combined with that of Dr. Freund, is now in the
Staatsbibliothek in Berlin and is undoubtedly the finest collection of
its kind.</p>
<p>Another famous collection of cookery books is described in My Cookery
Books, by Elizabeth Robins Pennell, Boston, 1903, listing three of the
Apicii.</p>
<p>The Pennell collection was destroyed by a flood in London while being
stored away in a warehouse during the world war.</p>
<p>The most important bibliography, well-known to bibliophiles, is the
Bibliographie gastronomique par Georges Vicaire, Paris, 1890. Vicaire
mentions eleven Apicius editions.</p>
<p>The Baron Pichon and the Georges Vicaire collections are both
dispersed.</p>
<p>Despite ardent efforts over a period of many years the writer has been
unable to secure either an Apicius manuscript or the editions No. 1
and 2. The existence of No. 2 on our list is doubtful. Therefore, we
do not pretend having inspected or read each and every edition
described herein, but by combining the efforts of the authorities here
cited we have gathered the following titles and descriptions in order
to present a complete survey of the Apician literature.</p>

SIGNERRE ROTHOMAGENSEM. ANNO DOMINI M CCCC LXXXX DIE
VIII MENSIS JANUARII.</code></pre><p>Large 8vo. Edition disputed by bibliographers.</p>
<p>Ex Bernhold, <em>præfatio</em>, p. IX, who (we are translating from his Latin
text) says, &quot;Here is the exterior of the book as extant in the
Nuremberg library, most accurately and neatly described by the very
famous and most worthy physician of that illustrious republic, Dr.
Preus, a friend of mine for thirty years; whose integrity, of course,
is above reproach; these are his own words—The book is made in the
size called large octavo. It must be mentioned that the sheets are
indeed large, so that the size might be styled an ordinary quarto.
Fabricius, in his Bibliotheca, the newest edition, quotes a copy under
this name. The entire book consists of five parts [sheets, folded into
eight leaves—sixteen printed pages—stitched together] and two
leaves. These five parts contain the text proper; these two sheets
preceding them, are occupied by the title page, the dedication and a
kind of poetic address. The text itself commences with p. 5, I should
say, though there is no regular pagination. However, there are
nevertheless in the lower ends of the leaves, called the limp parts,
some conspicuous letters on the first four leaves of the sheets, while
the remaining four leaves though belonging to the respective parts,
are blank. For instance aI., aII., aIII., aIIII. Then follows the next
sheet or part, signed, bI., II., III., IIII. in the same manner, with
the four following leaves blank. And thus in the same manner follows
sheet c, d, e. The two leaves preceding the five parts which comprise
the text proper, contain the title of the book, Apicius Culinaris
[_sic_] nowhere, to be sure, appears a note of the place or the date
where and when the book was made, and on this whole first page, aside
from the words already noted, there is nothing else in evidence than
the picture of an angel, in the center of which there is the sign,
IHS, and around the circle the following words are read, &#39;Joannes de
Lagniano M.&#39; At the feet of the angel spaces may be seen that are
inscribed with the letters, I.O.L. The next page, or the verso of the
title page, exhibits the dedication of Blasius Lancilotus, extending
to the upper part of the third page. On this very same page occurs the
poem by Ludovicus Vopiscus, addressed to Joannes Antonius Riscius,
comprising five very beautiful distichs. The remaining part of the
third page is finished off with the word, &#39;Finis,&#39; while the fourth
page is entirely blank. The text of Apicius commences with the fifth,
as mentioned above, and from now on the leaves are numbered by
letters, as previously described. At the end of the text, on the last
page of the book, a poem is conspicuous, entitled, &#39;Antonius Mota to
the Public,&#39; consisting of four neat distichs, followed by another
composition, containing five distichs by Joannes Salandus. And
conclusion of the entire work is made with these words, &#39;Printed at
Milan by Master Guiliermus de Signerre Rothomagensis, in the year of
the Lord 1490, on the 8th day of the month of January.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;From this edition, the oldest as well as the rarest—with no other
known earlier edition—all the variants given herewith have been
collected by Goezius.&quot; Thus far Bernhold.</p>
<p>The existence of this edition is doubted by Brunet, according to
Vicaire. This ancient description corresponds substantially to that of
Vicaire of the following edition of 1498 which Vicaire proclaims to be
the first dated Apicius edition. It is interesting to note, however,
what Bernhold has to say of this 1498 edition.</p>
<p>&quot;Without a doubt a repetition of the preceding edition,&quot; says he; and
he goes on quoting the Bibliotheca Latina Fabricio-Ernestina (Jo.
Alberti Fabricii Bibliothec. Latin. edit ab Ernesti 1708) to the
effect that two editions were printed at Milan, one of 1490 by Blasius
Lancilotus and one of 1498 by Guiliermus de Signerre Rothomagensis.</p>
<p>Our inquiry at the Municipal library of Nürnberg has revealed the
fact that this copy of 1490 is no longer in the possession of the
library there.</p>

de Vitalibus at Venice, no date, circa 1500 (our No. 1). This
classification follows that of Brunet in 1840. Neither the
Gesamtkatalog nor Brunet make any mention whatsoever of the doubtful
1490 Milan edition (our No. 2).</p>
<p>Vicaire, col. 33, mentioning this edition citing Bernhold, quotes
Brunet as doubting the existence of this 1490 edition, but we fail to
notice this expression of doubt since our Brunet is altogether silent
on the subject, same as the other bibliographers.</p>
<p>Vicaire, col. 28-29, quotes Brunet as saying that the undated Apicius
(our No. 1) despite its sub-titles of Suetonius, contains only the
Apicius text, a statement confirmed by Pennell.</p>
<p>A search of all the available works of Joh. Alb. Fabricius—Bibliotheca
Latina [Classics], Hamburg, 1722, Bibliographia Antiquaria, ib. 1760
and the Bibliotheca Latina mediæ et infimæ [middle ages], ib. 1735, has
failed to reveal a trace of the 1490 Apicius, displayed by Bernhold, as
described by Fabricius and as seen by Preus in the Nürnberg Municipal
Library.</p>
<p>Our facsimile of the 1498 colophon shows how easily its date can be
mistaken for &quot;the 8th day of January, 1490,&quot; Bernhold&#39;s very date!
Evidently an error of this kind made victims of Preus, Bernhold and
Fabricius (if, indeed, he quoted it) and caused us some ardent
searching among dusty tomes. We have therefore come to the conclusion
that either this 1490 edition disappeared between the year 1787 and
our time or else that it never existed.</p>

<p>This edition, printed in Lyons, France, in 1541, by Sebastian Gryphius
is said to have been pirated from the Torinus edition given at Basel
in the same year. Early printers stole copiously from one another,
frequently reproduced books with hundreds of illustrations with
startling speed. Gryphius corrected Torinus&#39; spelling of &quot;P&quot;
[Bartholomæus] Platina, but note the spelling of &quot;Lvg[v]dvni&quot; (Lyons).

<p>Strange enough, there is another edition of this work, bearing the
same editor&#39;s name, printed at Lyons, France, in the same year. This
edition, printed by Gryphius, bears the abbreviated title as follows:</p>
<p>NO. 6, A.D. 1541, LYONS</p>
<pre><code>CÆLII || APITII SVM || MI ADVLATRICIS || MEDICINÆ

INTER || PRETE.</code></pre><p>The lower center of the title page is occupied by the Gryphius
printer&#39;s device, a griffin standing on a box-like pedestal, supported
by a winged globe. On the left of the device: &quot;virtute duci,&quot; on the
right: &quot;comite fortuna&quot;; directly underneath: &quot;Apvd Seb. Gryphivm,
Lvgvdvni [_sic_], 1541.&quot; Sm. 8vo. Pages numbered, commencing with
verso of title from 2-314. Sheets lettered same as Basel edition; on
verso of title &quot;Katalogos&quot; etc. exactly like Basel. Page 3 commences
with the same epistola dedicatoria. This dedication and the entire
corpus of the book is printed in an awkward Italic type, except the
captions which are in 6 pt. and 8 pt. Roman. The book is quite an
unpleasant contrast with the fine Antiqua type and the generous
margins of the Basel edition. Some woodcut initials but of small
interest. The index, contrary to Basel, is in the back. The last page
shows another printer&#39;s device, differing from that on the title,
another griffin.</p>
<p>This edition, though bearing Platina&#39;s correct initial, B., has the
fictitious title given to his work by Torinus, who probably possessed
one of the earliest editions of Platina&#39;s De honesta Voluptate,
printed without a title page.</p>
<p>Altogether, this Lyons edition looks very much like a hurried job, and
we would not be surprised to learn that it was pirated from the Basel
edition.</p>
<p>The epistola dedicatoria, in which Torinus expresses fear of pirates
and asks his patron&#39;s protection, is concluded with the date, Basileæ,
v. Idus Martias, Anno M. D. XLI., while the copy described by Vicaire
appears to be without this date. Vicaire also says that the sheets of
his copy are not numbered. He also reads on the title &quot;Lvgdvni, 1541&quot;
which is spelled correctly, but not in accordance with the original.
Of these two editions Vicaire says:</p>
<p>&quot;Ces deux éditions portent la même date de 1541, mais celle qui a été
publiée à Bâle a paru avant celle donnée à Lyon par Seb. Gryphe. Cette
dernière, en effet, contient la dédicace datée.&quot; The title page of our
copy is inscribed by three different old hands, one the characteristic
remark: &quot;Mulcens me, gannis?&quot; This copy is bound in the original
vellum. Vicaire, 31, G.-Drexel, No. 12.</p>
<p>The work of Torinus has been subjected to a searching analysis, as
will be shown throughout the book. An appreciation of Platina will be
found in Platina, mæstro nell&#39;arte culinaria Un&#39;interessante studio di
Joseph D. Vehling, by Agostino Cavalcabò, Cremona, 1935.</p>

the preface in which Bernhold names this and other Apicius editions,
unknown to the bibliographers, the editor has not added any of his own
observations. Being under the influence of Lister, he joins the
English editor in the condemnation of Torinus. His work is valuable

<p>Although G.-Drexel, No. 1075, reads Apitius Cœlius, our copy agrees
with the reading of Vicaire, col. 889, appendix. Not in Pennell.
Brandt (Untersuchungen [No. 29] p. 6) calls Schuch <em>Wunderlicher
Querkopf</em>. He is correct. The Schuch editions are eccentric,
worthless.</p>

<p>LES DIX LIVRES DE CUISINE D&#39;APICIUS traduits du latin pour la Première
fois et commentés par Bertrand Guégan. Paris René Bonnel Éditeur rue
Blanche, No. 8.</p>
<p>No date (<em>in fine</em> October 16th, 1933). Three blank leaves, false
title; on verso, facing the title page (!) &quot;<em>du mème auteur</em>&quot;—a
full-page advertisement of the author&#39;s many-sided publications, past
and future. Title page, verso blank. On p. ix <em>Introduction</em>, a
lengthy discourse on dining in ancient times, including a mention of
Apician manuscripts and editions. This commences on p. Li with <em>Les
Manuscrits d&#39;Apicius</em>. The <em>Introduction</em> finishes on p. Lxxviii. On
p. 1 <em>Les Dix Livres d&#39;Apicius</em>, on p. 2 a facsimile in black of the
<em>incipit</em> of the Vatican manuscript, Apiciana II. On p. 3 commences
the translation into French of the Apician text, finishing on p. 308.
<em>Table Analytique</em> (index) pp. 309-322. Follow three unnumbered
sheets, on the first page of which is the <em>Justification du tirage</em>,
with the date of printing and the printer&#39;s name, Durand of Chartres.
The copies printed are numbered from 1 to 679. The copy before us is
No. 2; copies 1 to 4 are printed on Montval vellum, 5 to 29 on Dutch
Pannekoek vellum, the rest, 30 to 679 on Vidalon vellum paper.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the present work did not reach us until after ours had
gone to press. The text of this edition, the first to appear in the
French language, could not be considered in our work, for this reason.</p>
<p>However, a few casual remarks about it may be in order here.</p>
<p>A hasty perusal reveals the disconcerting fact that the editor has
been influenced by and has followed the example of Schuch by the
adoption of his system of numbering the recipes. We do not approve of
his inclusion of the excerpts of Vinidarius in the Apician text.</p>
<p>The observations presented in this edition are rich and varied. The
material, comprising the <em>Introduction</em> and also the explanatory
notes to the recipes are interesting, copious and well-authenticated.
The editor reveals himself to be a better scholar, well-read in the
classics, than a practical cook, well-versed in kitchen practice.
Frequently, for instance, he confounds <em>liquamen</em> with <em>garum</em>, the
age-old shortcoming of the Apician scholars.</p>
<p>The advertisement facing the title page of this work is misplaced,
disturbing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we welcome this French version which merits a thorough
study; this we hope to publish at some future date. Any serious and
new information on Apicius is welcome and much needed to clear up the
mysteries. The advent of a few additional cooks on the scene doesn&#39;t
matter. Let them give lie to the old proverb that too many cooks spoil
the broth. Apicius has been so thoroughly scrambled during the
sixteen-hundred years preceding his first printing which started the
scholars after him. So far, with the exception of a few minor
instances, they have done remarkably well. The complete unscrambling
can be done only by many new cooks, willing to devote much pain and
unremunerative, careful, patient work in discovering new evidence and
adding it to what there is already, to arrive at the truth of the
matter.</p>

<p>Dr. Edward Brandt, the philologist of Munich, is the latest of the
Apician commentators. His researches are quite exhaustive. While not
conclusive (as some of the problems will perhaps never be solved) he
has shed much new light on the vexatious questions of the origin and
the authors of our old Roman cookery book.</p>

<p>CENA, COENA, a meal, a repast; CENULA, a light luncheon; —— RECTA,
a &quot;regular&quot; meal, a formal dinner, usually consisting of GUSTUS,
appetizers and light ENTRÉES, the CENA proper which is the PIÈCE DE
RESISTANCE and the MENSÆ SECUNDAE, or desserts. The main dish was
the CAPUT CENAE; the desserts were also called BELLARIA or MENSAE
POMORUM, because they usually finished with fruit. Hence Horace&#39;s
saying &quot;AB OVO USQUE AD MALA&quot; which freely translated and modernized
means, &quot;Everything from soup to nuts.&quot;</p>

<p>—— PHILOSOPHICA, —— PLATONICA, —— LACONICA, —— RUSTICA,

and a —— SATURNIA is one without imported dishes or delicacies, a
national dinner</p>
<p>—— NOVENDIALIS is the feast given on the ninth day after the
burial of a dead man when his ashes were scattered while yet warm

<p>The CENA, to be sure, was an evening meal, the PRANDIUM, a noon-day
meal, a luncheon, any kind of meal; the JENTACULUM, a breakfast, an
early luncheon; the MERENDA was a snack in the afternoon between the
meals for those who had &quot;earned&quot; a bite</p>
<p>There are further CENAE, such as —— DAPSILIS, —— PELLOCIBILIS,
—— UNCTA, —— EPULARIS, —— REGALIS, all more or less generous
affairs, and our list of classical and sonorous dinner names is by

much thought was devoted to its character and arrangements</p>

<p>CIBARIUM ALBUM, white repast, white dish, blancmange. Fr. BLANC
MANGER, &quot;white eating.&quot; A very old dish. Platina gives a fine recipe
for it; in Apicius it is not yet developed. The body of this dish is
ground almonds and milk, thickened with meat jelly. Modern
cornstarch puddings have no longer a resemblance to it; to speak of
&quot;chocolate&quot; blancmange as we do, is a barbarism. Platina is proud of
his C.A. He prefers it to any Apician dessert. We agree with him;
the incomplete Apicius in Platina&#39;s and in our days has no desserts
worth mentioning. A German recipe of the 13th century (in &quot;Ein Buch
von guter Spise&quot;) calls C.A. &quot;Blamansier,&quot; plainly a corruption of
the French. By the translation of C.A. into the French, the origin
of the dish was obliterated, a quite frequent occurrence in French
kitchen terminology</p>

<p>CITRUS, orange or lemon tree and their fruits. It is remarkable that
Apicius does not speak of lemons, one of the most indispensable
fruits in modern cookery which grow so profusely in Italy today.
These were imported into Italy probably later. The ancients called a
number of other trees CITRUS also, including the cedar, the very
name of which is a corruption of CITRUS</p>

<p>CONDITURA, a pickle, a preserve, sauce, seasoning, marinade; the
three terms, C., CONDITUM and CONDIMENTUM are much the same in
meaning, and are used indiscriminately. They also designate sweet
dishes and desserts of different kinds, including many articles
known to us as confections. Hence the German, KONDITOR, for
confectioner, pastry cook. Nevertheless, a general outline of the
specific meanings of these terms may be gathered from observing the
nature of the several preparations listed under these headings,
particularly as follows: —— ROSATUM, ℞ 4; (cf. No. 5) ——
MELLIS, ℞ 17; —— UVARUM, ℞ 20; —— MALORUM PUNICORUM, ℞
21; —— COTONIORUM, ℞ 19; —— FICUUM, PRUNORUM, PIRORUM, ℞

DURACINORUM, ℞ 29; —— PRUNORUM, etc., ℞ 30
—in most of these instances corresponds to our modern
  &quot;preserving&quot;</p>
<p>CONGER, CONGRIO, CONGRUS, sea-eel, conger. CONGRUM QUEM ANTIATES
BRUNCHUM APPELLANT,—Platina, cf. ANGUILLA. Plautus uses this fish
name to characterize a very cunning person, a &quot;slippery&quot; fellow. A
cook is thus called CONGRIO in one of his plays</p>
<p>CONILA, CUNILA, a species of the plant ORIGANUM, origany, wild
marjoram. See SATUREIA</p>
<p>CONYZA, the viscous elecampane</p>
<p>Cook, COCUS, COQUUS is the most frequent form used, COCTOR,
infrequent. COQUA, COCULA, female cook; though female cooks were
few. The word is derived from COQUERE, to cook, which seems to be an
imitation of the sound, produced by a bubbling mess</p>
<p>The cook&#39;s work place (formerly ATRIUM, the &quot;black&quot; smoky room) was
the CULINA, the kitchen, hence in the modern Romance tongues
CUISINE, CUCINA, COCINA. Those who work there are CUISINIERS,
COCINEROS, the female a CUISINIÈRE, and so forth</p>
<p>The German and Swedish for &quot;kitchen&quot; are KÜCHE and KÖKET, but the
words &quot;cook&quot; and &quot;KOCH&quot; are directly related to COQUUS</p>
<p>A self-respecting Roman cook, especially a master of the art,
having charge of a crew, would assume the title of MAGIRUS, or
ARCHIMAGIRUS, chief cook. This Greek—&quot;MAGEIROS&quot;—plainly shows the
high regard in which Greek cookery stood in Rome. No American CHEF
would think of calling himself &quot;chief cook,&quot; although CHEF means
just that. The foreign word sounds ever so much better both in old
Rome and in new New York. MAGEIROS is derived from the Greek
equivalent of the verb &quot;to knead,&quot; which leads us to the art of
baking. Titles and distinctions were plentiful in the ancient
bakeshops, which plainly indicates departmentisation and division of
labor</p>
<p>The PISTOR was the baker of loaves, the DULCIARIUS the cake baker,
using honey for sweetening. Martial says of the PISTOR DULCIARIUS,
&quot;that hand will construct for you a thousand sweet figures of art;
for it the frugal bee principally labors.&quot; The PANCHESTRARIUS,
mentioned in Arnobius, is another confectioner. The LIBARIUS still
another of the sweet craft. The CRUSTULARIUS and BOTULARIUS were a
cookie baker and a sausage maker respectively</p>
<p>The LACTARIUS is the milkman; the PLACENTARIUS he who makes the
PLACENTA, a certain pancake, also a kind of cheese cake, often
presented during the Saturnalia. The SCRIBLITARIUS belongs here,
too: in our modern parlance we would perhaps call these two
&quot;ENTREMETIERS.&quot; The SCRIBLITA must have been a sort of hot cake,
perhaps an omelet, a pancake, a dessert of some kind, served hot;
maybe just a griddle cake, baked on a hot stone, a TORTILLA—what&#39;s
the use of guessing! but SCRIBLITAE were good, for Plautus, in one
of his plays, Poenulus, shouts, &quot;Now, then, the SCRIBLITAE are
piping hot! Come hither, fellows!&quot; Not all of them did eat, however,
all the time, for Posidippus derides a cook, saying, CUM SIS COQUUS,
PROFECTUS EXTRA LIMEN ES, CUM NON PRIUS COENAVERIS, &quot;What? Thou art
a cook, and hast gone, without dinner, over the threshold?&quot;</p>
<p>From the FOCARIUS, the scullion, the FORNACARIUS, the fireman, or
furnace tender, and the CULINARIUS, the general kitchen helper to
the OBSONATOR, the steward, the FARTOR to the PRINCEPS COQUORUM, the
&quot;maître d&#39;hôtel&quot; of the establishment we see an organization very
much similar to our own in any well-conducted kitchen</p>
<p>The Roman cooks, formerly slaves in the frugal days of the nation,
rose to great heights of civic importance with the spread of
civilization and the advance of luxury in the empire. Cf. &quot;The Rôle
of the Mageiroi in the Life of the Ancient Greeks&quot; by E. M. Rankin,
Chic., 1907, and &quot;Roman Cooks&quot; by C. G. Harcum, Baltimore, 1914, two
monographs on this subject</p>

<p>GARATUM, prepared with GARUM, which see</p>
<p>Gardener, The—Title of Book III, ℞ 377</p>
<p>GARUM (Gr.: GARON) a popular fish sauce made chiefly of the scomber
or mackerel, but formerly from the GARUS, hence the name, cf. p. 22,
℞ 10, 33, 471</p>
<p>Mackerel is the oiliest fish, and plentiful, very well suited for
the making of G.</p>
<p>G. was also a pickle made of the blood and the gills of the tunny
and of the intestines of mackerel and other fish. The intestines
were exposed to the sun and fermented. This has stirred up
controversies; the ancients have been denounced for the &quot;vile
concoctions,&quot; but garum has been vindicated by modern science as to
its rational preparation and nutritive qualities. Codfish oil, for
instance, has long been known for its medicinal properties,
principally Vitamin D; this is being increased today by exposure to
ultraviolet rays (just what the ancients did). The intestines are
the most nutritious portions of fish</p>
<p>G. still remains a sort of mystery. Its exact mode of preparation is
not known. It was very popular and expensive, therefore was subject
to a great number of variations in quality and in price, and to
adulteration. For all these reasons GARUM has been the subject of
much speculation. It appears that the original meaning of G. became
entirely lost in the subsequent variations</p>
<p>In 1933 Dr. Margaret B. Wilson sent the author a bottle of GARUM
ROMANUM which she had compounded according to the formulae at her
disposal. This was a syrupy brown liquid, smelled like glue and had
to be dissolved in water or wine, a few drops of the G. to a glass
of liquid, of which, in turn, only a few drops were used to flavor a
fish sauce, etc.</p>

<p>HYSITIUM, ISICIUM, a mince, a hash, a sausage, forcemeat, croquette,
℞ 41-56. The term &quot;croquette&quot; used by Gollmer does not fully
cover H.; some indeed, resemble modern croquettes and kromeskis very
closely. The ancients, having no table forks and only a few knives
(which were for the servants&#39; use in carving) were fond of such
preparations as could be partaken of without table ware. The
reclining position at table made it almost necessary for them to eat
H.; such dishes gave the cooks an opportunity for the display of
their skill, inventive ability, their decorative and artistic sense.
As &quot;predigested&quot; food, such dishes are decided preferable to the
&quot;<em>grosses-pièces</em>,&quot; which besides energetic mastication require
skillful manipulation of fork and knife; such exercise was unwelcome
on the Roman couches. Modern nations, featuring &quot;<em>grosses-pièces</em>&quot;
do this at the expense of high-class cookery. The word, H., is
probably a medieval graecification of INSICIUM. Cf. ISICIA</p>

agree that this is our present asa foetida, while other authorities
deny this. Some claim its home is in Persia, while others say the
best LASER came from Cyrene (Kyrene), Northern Africa. The center
picture of the so-called Arkesilas-Bowl of Vulci at Paris, Cab. d.
Méd. 189, represents a picture as seen by the artist in Kyrene how
King Arkesilas (VI. saec.) watches the weighing and the stowing away
in the hold of a sailing vessel of a costly cargo of sylphium. It
was an expensive and very much esteemed flavoring agent, and, for
that reason, the plant which grew only in the wild state, was
probably exterminated</p>

narcotic properties, as stated by Ovid and Plautus, but recent
researches have cast some doubt upon its reported deleterious
qualities. Apicius, ℞ 50, reads LOLAE FLORIS</p>
<p>LONGANO, a blood sausage, ℞ 61. The LONGANONES PORCINOS EX IURE
TARENTINO in ℞ 140 is a part of the PATINA EX LACTE; a pork
sausage made in Tarent of the straight gut, the rectum. Lister says
they are cooked in Tarentinian sauce and are not unlike the sausage
called APEXABO and HILLA. These sausages were in vogue before the
Italians learned to make them; it was in Epirus, Greece, that they
were highly developed. Their importation into Rome caused quite a
stir, politically. Lister, ℞ 50, p. 119, describes the sausage
and calls the inhabitants of Tarent &quot;most voluptuous, soft and
delicate&quot; because Juvenal, Sat. VI, v. 297, takes a shot at Tarent</p>
<p>This part of Italy, and especially Sicily, because in close contact

cookery than the North</p>

Platina also calls it LICIUS. Cf. MERULA</p>

<p>MALUM, fruit, an apple, but quinces, pomegranates, peaches, oranges,
lemons, and other fruits were likewise designated by this name. ℞
18, 20. See also CITRUM</p>
<p>It is remarkable that Apicius does not specifically speak of lemons
and oranges, fruits that must have grown in Italy at his time, that
are so indispensable to modern cookery</p>
<p>MALUM PUNICUM, ℞ 20, 21; —— CYDONIUM, ℞ 21; —— GRANATUM,
℞ 20; —— MEDICUM, ℞ 24; —— ROSEUM, ℞ 178, 171. This name,
which according to Schuch simply stands for a rose-colored apple,
has led to the belief that the ancients made pies, etc., of roses.
Today a certain red-colored apple is known as &quot;Roman Beauty.&quot; We
concur in Schuch&#39;s opinion, remembering, however, that the fruit of
the rose tree, namely the hip, dog-briar, or eglantine, is made into
dainty confections on the Continent today. It is therefore quite
possible that MALUM ROSEUM stands for the fruit of the rose</p>
<p>MANDUCO, to chew, to munch, to enjoy food by munching; a glutton</p>
<p>MAPPA, table napkin (Fr. nappe). M. is a Punic word, according to
Quintil. 1, 5, 57</p>
<p>Each banquet guest brought with him from his own home such a napkin
or cloth which he used during the banquet to wipe his mouth and
hands. The ancients, evidently, were conscious of the danger of
infection through the common use of napkins and table ware.
Sometimes they used their napkins to wrap up part of the meal and to
give it to their slaves to carry home in. Horace, Martial, Petronius
attest to this fact. The banquet guests also employed their own
slaves to wait on them at their Host&#39;s party. This custom and the
individual napkin habit have survived until after the French
revolution. Grimod de la Reynière, in his Almanach des Gourmands,
Paris, 1803, seq., describes how guests furnished their own napkins
and servants for their own use at parties to which they were invited</p>
<p>This rather sensible custom relieved the host of much responsibility
and greatly assisted him in defraying the expenses of the dinner. On
the other hand it reveals the restrictions placed upon any host by
the general shortage of table ware, table linen, laundering
facilities in the days prior to the mechanical age</p>

Platina and Aegineta of the evolution of a term from the antique to
the medieval Latin and finally emerging into modern Italian. What
better proof, if necessary, could be desired than this etymology for
the authenticity of the Apicius book? Its age could be proven by a
philologist if no other proof were at hand</p>

<p>STURNUS, a starling, stare; Platina condemns its meat as unfit,
likewise that of the blackbird (cf. MERULA); he pronounces their
flesh to be &quot;devilish.&quot; &quot;STURNI, QUOS VULGO DIABOLICAM CARNEM HABERE
DICIMUS.&quot; Yet three-hundred years later, French authorities
recommend this sort of food. Viger, La Nouvelle Maison Rustique,
Paris, 1798, Vol. iii, p. 613, tells how to catch and fatten STURNI.
&quot;After a month [of forced feeding] they will be nice and fat and
good to eat and to sell; there are persons who live of this trade.&quot;
He praises the crow similarly</p>
<p>These instances are cited not only as a commentary upon the taste of
the Southern people and their habits which have endured to this day
but also to illustrate the singular genius of Platina. Also the
following notes to STYRIO tend to show how far advanced was Platina
in the matter of food as compared with the masters of the 18th
century in France</p>
<p>STYRIO, STIRIO, STURIO, ℞ 145, sturgeon; probably the same fish
as known to the ancients as ACIPENSER or STURIO. (A. SIVE S. OBLONGO
TEREDEQUE—Stephanus à Schonevelde, in Ichthyologia, Hamburg, 1624).
There can be no doubt that the sturgeon or sterlet is meant by this
term, for Platina calls the eggs of the fish &quot;caviare.&quot; &quot;OVA
STIRIONIS CONDITUM QUOD CAUARE UOCANT.&quot; Eloquently he describes his
struggle with the changing language. The efforts of this
conscientious man, Platina, to get at the bottom of things no matter
how trivial they may appear, are highly praiseworthy</p>
<p>He writes &quot;DE STIRIONE. TRAHI PER TENEBRAS NŪC MIHI VIDEOR,
QUANDO HORŪ, DE QUIBUS, DEINCEPS DICTURUS SUM, PISCIŪ, NULLUS
CERTUS UEL NOMINIS, UEL NATURAE EXISTAT AUTOR. NEGLIGENTIAE MAIORUM
&amp; INSCITIAE ID MAGIS, QUÀM MIHI ASCRIBENDUM EST. VTAR EGO NOUIS
NOMINIBUS NE DELICATORUM GULAE PER ME DICANT STETISSE, QUO MINUS
INTEGRA UTERENTUR UOLUPTATE.&quot;</p>
<p>As for the rest, Platina cooks the sturgeon precisely in our own
modern way: namely in water, white wine and vinegar. And: &quot;SALEM
INDERE MEMENTO!—don&#39;t forget the salt!&quot;</p>
<p>Compare him with France 350 years later. As for caviare, A.
Beauvilliers, in his L&#39;Art du cuisinier, Paris, 1814, treats this
&quot;ragoût&quot; as something entirely new; yet Beauvilliers was the leading
restaurateur of his time and a very capable cook, save Carême, the
best. Beauvilliers has no use for caviare which he calls &quot;Kavia.&quot;
Says he: &quot;LES RUSSES EN FONT UN GRAND CAS ET L&#39;ACHETENT FORT CHER
[The Russians make a big thing of this and buy it very dearly] CE
RAGOUT, SELON MOI, NE CONVIENT QU&#39; AUX RUSSES—this stew, according
to my notion, suits only the Russians or those who have traveled
thereabouts.&quot;</p>
<p>Shakespeare, in speaking about &quot;Caviare to the General&quot; apparently
was more up-to-date in culinary matters than this Parisian
authority. A search of the eight volumes (Vol. I, 1803) of the
famous Almanach des Gourmands by Grimod de la Reynière, Paris, 1803,
seq., fails to reveal a trace of caviare</p>
<p>A German cook, a hundred years after Platina, Marx Rumpolt in &quot;Ein
new Kochbuch, Franckfort am Mayn, bey Johan Feyrabendt, 1587&quot; on
verso of folio XCVII, No. 9, gives an exact description of caviare
and its mode of preparation. He calls it ROGEN VOM HAUSEN. The
HAUSEN is the real large sturgeon, the Russian Beluga from which the
best caviare is obtained. Rumpolt, whose book is the finest and most
thorough of its kind in the middle ages, and a great work in every
respect, remarks that caviare is good eating, especially for
Hungarian gentlemen</p>

<p>VINUM, wine; —— CANDIDUM FACIES, ℞ 8; many technical terms are
given to wines, according to their qualities, such as ALBUM,
CONDITUM, FUSCUM, NIGRUM, LIMPIDUM, ATRUM, DURUM, FULVUM, SANGUINEM,
RUBENS, FIERI, BONUM, DULCE SUAVUM, FIRMUM, SALUBRE, DILUTUM,
VAPIDUM, etc. These, as our modern terms, are employed to designate
the &quot;bouquet,&quot; color and other characteristics of wine. Then there
are the names of the different brands coming from different parts,
too numerous to mention. Furthermore there are wines of grapes, old
and new, plain or distilled, raw or cooked, pure and diluted,
natural or flavored, and the many different drinks made of grape
wine with herbs and spices</p>
<p>V. NIGRUM, &quot;black wine,&quot; may be muddy wine in need of clarification;
there is some slight doubt about this point. It appears that the
vintner of old was much more tempted to foist unworthy stuff upon
his customers than his colleague of today who is very much
restricted by law and guided by his reputation</p>
<p>VINUM also is any drink or liquor resembling grape wine, any
home-made wine fermented or fresh. There is a V. EX NAPIS, ——
PALMEUM, —— EX CAROTIS, —— EX MILII SEMINE, —— EX LOTO, ——
EX FICO, —— EX PUNCICIS, —— EX CORNIS, —— EX MESPILIS, —— EX
SORBIS, —— EX MORIS, —— EX NUCLEIS PINEIS, —— EX PIRIS, ——
EX MALIS, (cf. Pliny), resembling our cider, perry, berry wines and
other drink or liquor made of fruit, berries, vegetables or seeds</p>
<p>VIOLATIUM and ROSATIUM, ℞ 5, are laxatives; —— ORIGANUM is wine
flavored with origany; etc., etc.</p>
<p>It is doubtful, however, that the Romans knew the art of
distillation to the extent as perfected by the Arabs centuries later
and brought to higher perfection by the medical men and alchymists
of the middle ages</p>

length on the subject. The humane Plutarch tells of revolting detail
in connection with the slaughter of swine in order to obtain just
the kind of V. that was considered the best</p>

<p>[Through the good offices of Dr. Edwardt Brandt, of
Munich, the above two commentaries on Apicius were
received in the last moment, thanks to the courtesy of
the author, Lekto J. Svennung, of Uppsala, Sweden. The
first study is a critique of technical terms and
colloquialisms as found in Palladius, touching
frequently upon Apicius, published in 1935 at Uppsala by
the Vilhelm Ekman University Foundation and the other is
a reprint of an article on a number of Apician formulae
from Eranos, Vol. XXXIV, published at Gothenburg, 1936,
by Elander, Ltd.</p>

<p>The following have also been noted:</p>
<p>The author has consistently used minuscle rather than
minuscule when referring to manuscript. Since it appears
deliberate, it has been preserved as printed.</p>
<p>Page 9 has a word obscured—&quot;one of three known famous
—— bearing that name&quot;. Another source of the text has
the word as &#39;eaters&#39;, so the same has been used here.</p>
<p>Page 23 has a reference to a &quot;modern&quot; sauce, A I. There
were no obvious references to be found for a sauce of
that name, so it may be a typo for A1 sauce, which was
available at the time of writing. As there is no way to
be certain, however, it has been preserved as printed.</p>
<p>Page 49—note to recipe 13 reads, &quot;Exactly as we today
with fried herring and river lamprey&quot;. It is possible
that it should read &quot;as we do today&quot;, but has been left
as printed.</p>
<p>Page 151—recipe 241 has a note 1, but no marker in the
text.</p>
<p>Page 166—recipe 275 has a marker for note 1, but no
note with that number.</p>
<p>Page 172—Note 1 to recipe 294 reads &quot;making it convenient
and unprofitable for the domestic cook&quot;—this should
probably be read as &quot;inconvenient and unprofitable&quot;,
but it has been left as printed.</p>
<p>Page 175—recipe 305 has a marker for note 2, but no
note with that number.</p>
<p>Page 189—recipe 351 has a marker for note 2, but no
note with that number.</p>
<p>Page 211—recipe 405a has a marker for note 2, but no
note with that number.</p>
<p>Page 226—there is no title for recipe 445.</p>
<p>Page 230—there is no Latin translation provided for the
heading &quot;EEL&quot;.</p>
<p>Page 243—recipe 481 is titled &quot;FISH STEWED IN WINE&quot;,
but does not mention wine anywhere in the recipe itself.</p>
<p>Page 284—contained incorrectly placed index entries for
CLIBANUS, CNICOS and CNISSA (following COXA). These have
been moved to the correct place.</p>
<p>Page 291—the index entry for Morsels also seems to have
had the recipe references (309, seq.) for Morels included;
this has been preserved as printed.</p>
<p>Page 291—contained incorrectly placed index entry for
Mullet (following MUSTUM). This has been moved to the
correct place.</p>
<p>Page 292—in the subentry for OLUS (OLUS AND CAULUS),
there is an ℞ but no number.</p>
