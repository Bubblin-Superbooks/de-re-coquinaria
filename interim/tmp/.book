The\nbook has been printed again and again in Latin and has been translated\ninto Italian and German. It is unnecessary to here give historic\ndetails regarding the work as Mr. Vehling goes fully and admirably\ninto the subject. In 1705 the book was printed in Latin at London,\nwith notes by Dr. Martinus Lister. It caused some stir in the England\nof that time. In a very curious book, The Art of Cookery, in Imitation\nof Horace's Art of Poetry, with Some Letters to Dr. Lister and Others,\nDr. Wm. King says:</p>",
  "page-21": "<pre class=\"  \"><code>\"The other curiosity is the admirable piece of Cœlius\nApicius, '_De Opsoniis et condimentis sive arte\ncoquinaria, Libri decem_' being ten books of soups and\nsauces, and the art of cookery, as it is excellently\nprinted for the doctor, who in this important affair, is\nnot sufficiently communicative....\n\n\"I some days ago met with an old acquaintance, of whom I\ninquired if he has seen the book concerning soups and\nsauces? He told me he had, but that he had but a very\nslight view of it, the person who was master of it not\nbeing willing to part with so valuable a rarity out of\nhis closet. I desired him to give me some account of it.\nHe says that it is a very handsome octavo, for, ever\nsince the days of Ogilvy, good paper and good print, and\nfine cuts, make a book become ingenious and brighten</pre>",

And our edition has nothing to lose by\ncomparison with the old one. For this, too, is a handsome book, with\ngood paper and good print and fine cuts. And the man who produces it\ncan equally bear comparison with Dr. Lister and more earlier\ncommentators and editors whom he quotes—Humelbergius and Caspar\nBarthius.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The preparation of such a book is no simple task and requires a rare\ncombination of qualities. Mr. Vehling possesses this unusual\ncombination. He was born some</p>",
  "page-23": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">forty-five years ago in the small town\nof Duelken on the German-Dutch frontier—a town proverbial for the\ndullness of its inhabitants. There was nothing of dullness about the\nboy, however, for at the age of fourteen years, he had already four\nyears study of Latin and one of Greek to his credit. Such was his\nrecord in Latin that his priest teachers attempted to influence him\ntoward the priesthood. His family, however, had other plans and\nbelieving that he had enough schooling, decided that he should be a\ncook. As he enjoyed good food, had a taste for travel and\nindependence, and was inclined to submit to family direction, he\nrather willingly entered upon the career planned for him. He learned\nthe business thoroughly and for six years practiced his art in\nGermany, Belgium, France, England and Scandinavia. Wherever he went,\nhe gave his hours of freedom to reading and study in libraries and\nmuseums.</p>",
  "page-24": "<p>During his first trip through Italy and on a visit to Pompeii he\nconceived the idea of depicting some day the table of the Romans and\nof making the present translation. He commenced to gather all the\nnecessary material for this work, which included intensive studies of\nthe ancient arts and languages. Meanwhile, he continued his hotel work\nalso, quite successfully. At the age of twenty-four he was assistant\nmanager of the fashionable Hotel Bristol, Vienna.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">However, the necessities of existence prevented his giving that time\nand study to art, which is necessary if it was to become a real\ncareer. In Vienna he found music, drama, languages, history,\nliterature and gastronomy, and met interesting people from all parts\nof the globe. While the years at Vienna were the happiest of his life,\nhe had a distaste for the \"superheated, aristocratic and military\natmosphere.\" It was at that city that he met the man who was\nresponsible for his coming to America.</p>",
  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Were we writing Mr. Vehling's\nbiography, we would have ample material for a racy and startling\nnarrative. We desire only to indicate the remarkable preparation for\nthe work before us, which he has had. A Latin scholar of exceptional\npromise, a professional cook of pronounced success, and an artist\ncompetent to illustrate his own work! Could such a combination be\nanticipated? It is the combination that has made this book possible.</p><p>The book has claims even upon our busy and practical generation. Mr.\nVehling has himself stated them:</p><pre class=\"  \"><code>\"The important addition to our knowledge of the\nancients—for our popular notions about their table are\nentirely erroneous and are in need of revision.\n\n\"The practical value of many of the ancient</pre>",

He was for five years\nmanager of catering at the Hotel Pfister in Milwaukee; for two and a\nhalf years he was inspector and instructor of the Canadian Pacific\nRailway; he was connected with some of the leading hotels in New York\nCity, and with the Eppley and the</p>",

It is to be hoped that both will eventually be published in\nbook form.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There is no financial lure in getting out an English translation of\nApicius. It is a labor of love—but worth the doing. We have claimed\nthat Mr. Vehling has exceptional fitness for the task. This will be\nevident to anyone who reads his book. An interesting feature of his\npreparation is the fact that Mr. Vehling has subjected many of the\nformulæ to actual test.

Two serious students, Schuch and Wuestemann, gave up\nacademic positions to devote a year to the study of modern cookery in\norder to be able to interpret Apicius. These enthusiasts overlooked,\nhowever, two facts: Apicius cannot be understood by inquiring into\nmodern average cookery methods, nor can complete mastery of cookery,\npractical as well as theoretical, including the historical and\nphysiological aspects of gastronomy be acquired in one year. Richard\nGollmer, another Apicius editor, declares that the results of this\ncourse in gastronomy were negative.

Danneil's preface is dated\n1897, though the date of publication is 1911. In view of the fact\nthat Gollmer had covered the ground and that Danneil added nothing\nnew to Apician lore, his publication seems superfluous.
