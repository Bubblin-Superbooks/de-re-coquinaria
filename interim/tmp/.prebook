It is unnecessary to here give historic\ndetails regarding the work as Mr. Vehling goes fully and admirably\ninto the subject. In 1705 the book was printed in Latin at London,\nwith notes by Dr. Martinus Lister. It caused some stir in the England\nof that time. In a very curious book, The Art of Cookery, in Imitation\nof Horace's Art of Poetry, with Some Letters to Dr. Lister and Others,\nDr. Wm. King says:"

He told me he had, but that he had but a very\nslight view of it, the person who was master of it not\nbeing willing to part with so valuable a rarity out of\nhis closet. I desired him to give me some account of it.\nHe says that it is a very handsome octavo, for, ever\nsince the days of Ogilvy, good paper and good print, and\nfine cuts, make a book become ingenious and brighten up\nan author strangely. That there is a copious index; and\nat the end a catalogue of all the doctor's works,\nconcerning cockles, English beetles, snails, spiders,\nthat get up into the air and throw us down cobwebs; a\nmonster vomited up by a baker and such like; which if\ncarefully perused, would wonderfully improve us.\"</code>"

He was born some forty-five years ago in the small town\nof Duelken on the German-Dutch frontier—a town proverbial for the\ndullness of its inhabitants. There was nothing of dullness about the\nboy, however, for at the age of fourteen years, he had already four\nyears study of Latin and one of Greek to his credit. Such was his\nrecord in Latin that his priest teachers attempted to influence him\ntoward the priesthood. His family, however, had other plans and\nbelieving that he had enough schooling, decided that he should be a\ncook. As he enjoyed good food, had a taste for travel and\nindependence, and was inclined to submit to family direction, he\nrather willingly entered upon the career planned for him. He learned\nthe business thoroughly and for six years practiced his art in\nGermany, Belgium, France, England and Scandinavia. Wherever he went,\nhe gave his hours of freedom to reading and study in libraries and\nmuseums."

    "innerHtml": "During his first trip through Italy and on a visit to Pompeii he\nconceived the idea of depicting some day the table of the Romans and\nof making the present translation. He commenced to gather all the\nnecessary material for this work, which included intensive studies of\nthe ancient arts and languages. Meanwhile, he continued his hotel work\nalso, quite successfully. At the age of twenty-four he was assistant\nmanager of the fashionable Hotel Bristol, Vienna."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "However, the necessities of existence prevented his giving that time\nand study to art, which is necessary if it was to become a real\ncareer. In Vienna he found music, drama, languages, history,\nliterature and gastronomy, and met interesting people from all parts\nof the globe. While the years at Vienna were the happiest of his life,\nhe had a distaste for the \"superheated, aristocratic and military\natmosphere.\" It was at that city that he met the man who was\nresponsible for his coming to America. Were we writing Mr. Vehling's\nbiography, we would have ample material for a racy and startling\nnarrative. We desire only to indicate the remarkable preparation for\nthe work before us, which he has had. A Latin scholar of exceptional\npromise, a professional cook of pronounced success, and an artist\ncompetent to illustrate his own work! Could such a combination be\nanticipated? It is the combination that has made this book possible."

He not only has the practical side of food use and\npreparation, he is an authority upon the science in his field. His\nprinted articles on food and cookery have been read with extraordinary\ninterest, and his lectures upon culinary matters have been well\nreceived. It is to be hoped that both will eventually be published in\nbook form."

The town had hardly recuperated from a preliminary attack by\nthat treacherous mountain, Vesuvius, when a second onslaught succeeded\nin complete destruction. Suddenly, without warning, this lumbering\n<em>force majeur</em> visited the ill-fated towns in its vicinity with\nmerciless annihilation. The population, just then enjoying the games in\nthe amphitheatre outside of the \"downtown\" district, had had hardly\ntime to save their belongings. They escaped with their bare lives. Only\nthe aged, the infirm, the prisoners and some faithful dogs were left\nbehind. Today their bodies in plaster casts may be seen, mute witnesses\nto a frightful disaster. The town was covered with an airtight blanket\nof ashes, lava and fine pumice stone. There was no prolonged death\nstruggle, no perceivable decay extended over centuries as was the cruel\nlot of Pompeii's mistress, Rome. There were no agonies to speak of. The\ngreat event was consummated within a few hours. The peace of death\nsettled down to reign supreme after the dust had been driven away by\nthe gentle breezes coming in from the bay of Naples. Some courageous\ncitizens returned, searching in the hot ashes for the crashed-in roofs\nof their villas, to recover this or that. Perhaps they hoped to salvage\nthe strong box in the atrium, or a heirloom from the triclinium. But\nsoon they gave up. Despairing, or hoping for better days to come, they\nvanished in the mist of time. Pompeii, the fair, the hospitable, the\ngay city, just like any individual out of luck, was and stayed\nforgotten. The Pompeians, their joys, sorrows, their work and play,\ntheir virtues and vices—everything was arrested with one single\nstroke, stopped, even as a camera clicks, taking a snapshot."

Apicius here reveals himself as the consummate\ncook who is familiar with the finest detail of physical\nand chemical changes which food undergoes at varying\ntemperatures.\n\nThe various editions all agree: _asparagos siccabis_;\nSchuch, however, says: \"For the insane _siccabis_ I\nsubstitute _siciabis_, _isiciabis_, prepare with _sicio_\n[?] and cook.\" He even goes on to interpret it _cucabis_\nfrom the Greek _kouki_, cocoanut milk, and infers that\nthe asparagus was first cooked in cocoanut milk and then\nput back into water, a method we are tempted to\npronounce insane.\n\n[2] V. Backwards! G.-V. _rursum in calidam_; Tac.\n_rursus in aquam calidam_; Tor. _ac rursus ..._\n\nThis word has caused us some reflection, but the ensuing\ndiscovery made it worth while. _Rursus_ has escaped the\nattention of the other commentators. In this case\n_rursus_ means backwards, being a contraction from\n_revorsum_, h.e. _reversum_. The word is important\nenough to be observed.\n\nApicius evidently has the right way of cooking the fine\nasparagus. The stalks, after being peeled and washed\nmust be bunched together and tied according to sizes,\nand the bunches must be set into the boiling water\n\"backwards,\" that is, they must stand upright with the\nheads protruding from the water. The heads will be made\ntender above the water line by rising steam and will be\ndone simultaneously with the harder parts of the stalks.\nWe admit, we have never seen a modern cook observe this\nmethod. They usually boil the tender heads to death\nwhile the lower stalks are still hard.\n\nThough this formula is incomplete (it fails to state the\nsauce to be served, also that the asparagus must be\npeeled and bunched, that the water must contain salt,\netc.) it is one of the neatest formulæ in Apicius. It is\namusing to note how the author herein unconsciously\nreveals what a poor litérateur but what a fine cook he\nis. This is characteristic of most good practitioners.\nOne may perfectly master the vast subject of cookery,\nyet one may not be able to give a definition of even a\nsingle term, let alone the ability to exactly describe\none of the many processes of cookery. Real poets often\nare in the same predicament; none of them ever explained\nthe art satisfactorily.\n\n[3] G.-V. add to the formula _callosiores reddes_—give\nback [eliminate] the harder ones. This sentence belongs\nto the next article. And Torinus, similar to\nHumelbergius, renders this sentence _ut reddas ad gustum\ncalliores_—to render the harder ones palatable—the\nsquash and pumpkin namely—and we are inclined to agree\nwith him.</code>"

The emasculated bird\ngrew fat without his owner committing any infraction of\nthe Roman law against fattening chickens. Of course the\ncapon, being neither hen nor rooster, was perfectly safe\nto eat, for he was within the law.

Beans later in the season are cooked\nwith potatoes. The young beans are tied with flour\ndissolved in water, or with roux.\n\n_Id. ibid._, ℞ No. 212, Beans Sweet-Sour.

If not sour enough, add vinegar,\nbut right here you must add more fat; you may lay on top\nof this dish a bouquet of sliced apples.\n\n_Id. ibid._, ℞ No. 214, Beans and Pears. Take cut and\npickled beans and prepare as above. To this add peeled\nfresh pears, cut into quarters; then sugar, lemon peel\ncut thin, cinnamon, \"English\" mixed spices, and at last\nthe roux, thinned with broth. This dish must be sweet\nand very fat.\n\nAs for exotic combinations, Apicius surely survives\nhere, is even surpassed by this Jewish cookery book\nwhere, no doubt, very ancient traditions have been\nstored away.</code>"

III.\n\n[2] Tor. who is trying hard to explain the _colocasium_.\nHis name, \"Egyptian Bean\" may be due to the mealiness\nand bean-like texture of the _colocasium_ tuber;\notherwise there is no resemblance to a bean, except,\nperhaps, the seed pod which is not used for food. This\nsimile has led other commentators to believe that the\n_colocasium_ in reality was a bean.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has in recent years\nimported various specimens of that taro species\n(belonging to the _colocasia_), and the plants are now\nsuccessfully being farmed in the southern parts of the\nUnited States, with fair prospects of becoming an\nimportant article of daily diet. The Department has\nfavored us repeatedly with samples of the taro, or\ndasheen, (_Colocasium Antiquorum_) and we have made many\ndifferent experiments with this agreeable, delightful\nand important \"new\" vegetable. It can be prepared in\nevery way like a potato, and possesses advantages over\nthe potato as far as value of nutrition, flavor, culture\nand keeping qualities are concerned. As a commercial\narticle, it is not any more expensive than any good kind\nof potato. It grows where the potato will not thrive,\nand vice versa. It thus saves much in freight to parts\nwhere the potato does not grow.\n\nThe ancient _colocasium_ is no doubt a close relative of\nthe modern dasheen or taro. The Apician _colocasium_ was\nperhaps very similar to the ordinary Elephant-Ear,\n_colocasium Antiquorum Schott_, often called _caladium\nesculentum_, or _tanyah_, more recently called the\n\"Dasheen\" which is a corruption of the French \"de\nChine\"—from China—indicating the supposed origin of\nthis variety of taro. The dasheen is a broad-leaved\nmember of the _arum_ family. The name dasheen originated\nin the West Indies whence it was imported into the\nUnited States around 1910, and the name is now\nofficially adopted.\n\nMark Catesby, in his Natural History of Carolina,\nFlorida and the Bahama Islands, London, 1781, describes\nbriefly under the name of _arum maximum Aegypticum_ a\nplant which was doubtless one of the tanyahs or taros.\nHe says: \"This was a welcome improvement among the\nnegroes and was esteemed a blessing; they being\ndelighted with all their African food, particularly\nthis, which a great part of Africa subsists much on.\"\n\nTorinus, groping for the right name, calls it variously\n_colosium_, _coledium_, _coloesium_, till he finally\ngets it right, _colocasium_.\n\n[3] The root or tubers of this plant was used by the\nancients as a vegetable. They probably boiled and then\npeeled and sliced the tubers, seasoning the pieces with\nthe above ingredients, heated them in bouillon stock and\nthickened the gravy in the usual way. Since the tuber is\nvery starchy, little roux is required for binding.\n\n[4] Afterthought by Tor. printed in italics on the\nmargin of his book.</code>"

This also illustrates the interesting\netymology of the word. It is not recognized in every-day\nancient language because it is a typical technical term,\nthe much complained-of _lingua culinaria_. We find,\ntherefore, that—at least in this instance—_garum_ no\nlonger stands for a sauce made from the fish, _garus_,\nbut that _garum_ has become a generic term for certain\nkinds of sauces. Danneil renders _garatus_ with\n_lasaratus_, which is clearly out of place.\n\n[2] In this instance, and in several others, and also\naccording to Sueton. Cæs. fluids were weighed. What idea\ncould be more practical, useful and more \"modern\" than\nthis? Sheer commercial greed, stubbornness, indolence\nhave thus far made futile all efforts towards more\nprogressive methods in handling food stuffs,\nparticularly in the weighing of them and in selling them\nby their weight. Present market methods are very\nchaotic, and are kept purposely so to the detriment of\nthe buyer.\n\n[3] The original: _et sic frigis_.—_Frigo_ is\nequivalent to frying, drying, parching; the word here\nhas taken on a broader meaning, because the \"frying\"\nprocess is clearly out of question here. It appears that\nthe terminology of _frigo_ and that of _asso_ in the\nnext formula, has not been clearly defined. As a matter\nof fact, not many modern cooks today are able to give a\nclear definition of such terms as frying, broiling,\nroasting, braising, baking, which are thus subject to\nvarious interpretations.</code>"

The way Torinus speaks of it and of the (first) Venetian\nprinted edition in his <em>epistola dedicatoria</em> leaves even doubt as to\nwhether his authority was handwritten or printed. A first edition,\nprinted ca. 1483, may have well been a dilapidated copy such as\nTorinus describes in 1529. Torinus admits taking some liberties with\nthe text and failed to understand some phrases of it.

IX, who (we are translating from his Latin\ntext) says, \"Here is the exterior of the book as extant in the\nNuremberg library, most accurately and neatly described by the very\nfamous and most worthy physician of that illustrious republic, Dr.\nPreus, a friend of mine for thirty years; whose integrity, of course,\nis above reproach; these are his own words—The book is made in the\nsize called large octavo. It must be mentioned that the sheets are\nindeed large, so that the size might be styled an ordinary quarto.\nFabricius, in his Bibliotheca, the newest edition, quotes a copy under\nthis name. The entire book consists of five parts [sheets, folded into\neight leaves—sixteen printed pages—stitched together] and two\nleaves. These five parts contain the text proper; these two sheets\npreceding them, are occupied by the title page, the dedication and a\nkind of poetic address. The text itself commences with p. 5, I should\nsay, though there is no regular pagination. However, there are\nnevertheless in the lower ends of the leaves, called the limp parts,\nsome conspicuous letters on the first four leaves of the sheets, while\nthe remaining four leaves though belonging to the respective parts,\nare blank. For instance aI., aII., aIII., aIIII. Then follows the next\nsheet or part, signed, bI., II., III., IIII. in the same manner, with\nthe four following leaves blank. And thus in the same manner follows\nsheet c, d, e. The two leaves preceding the five parts which comprise\nthe text proper, contain the title of the book, Apicius Culinaris\n[_sic_] nowhere, to be sure, appears a note of the place or the date\nwhere and when the book was made, and on this whole first page, aside\nfrom the words already noted, there is nothing else in evidence than\nthe picture of an angel, in the center of which there is the sign,\nIHS, and around the circle the following words are read, 'Joannes de\nLagniano M.' At the feet of the angel spaces may be seen that are\ninscribed with the letters, I.O.L. The next page, or the verso of the\ntitle page, exhibits the dedication of Blasius Lancilotus, extending\nto the upper part of the third page. On this very same page occurs the\npoem by Ludovicus Vopiscus, addressed to Joannes Antonius Riscius,\ncomprising five very beautiful distichs. The remaining part of the\nthird page is finished off with the word, 'Finis,' while the fourth\npage is entirely blank. The text of Apicius commences with the fifth,\nas mentioned above, and from now on the leaves are numbered by\nletters, as previously described. At the end of the text, on the last\npage of the book, a poem is conspicuous, entitled, 'Antonius Mota to\nthe Public,' consisting of four neat distichs, followed by another\ncomposition, containing five distichs by Joannes Salandus. And\nconclusion of the entire work is made with these words, 'Printed at\nMilan by Master Guiliermus de Signerre Rothomagensis, in the year of\nthe Lord 1490, on the 8th day of the month of January.'"
