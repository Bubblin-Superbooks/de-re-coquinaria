<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Modern Research</h4><p class="  start-chapter">Modern means of communication and photography have enabled scientists
in widely different parts to study our book from all angles, to
scrutinize the earliest records, the Vatican and the New York
manuscripts and the codex Salmasianus in Paris.</p><p>Friedrich Vollmer, of Munich, in his <em>Studien</em> (cit. Apiciana) has
treated the manuscripts exhaustively, carrying to completion the
research begun by Schuch, Traube, Ihm, Studemund, Giarratano and
others with Brandt, his pupil, carrying on the work of Vollmer. More
modern scientists deeply interested in the origin of our book! None
doubting its genuineness.</p></div> </div>
