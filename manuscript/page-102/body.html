Vollmer, too, rejects the idea invented by the humanists, that Apicius
had a collaborator, editor or commentator in the person of Cœlius
or Cælius. This name, so Vollmer claims, has been added to the book by
medieval scholars without any reason except conjecture for such
action. They have been misled by the mutilated title: Api... Cæ...;
Vollmer reconstructs this title as follows:</p><pre><code>    API[cii artis magiri- (or) opsartyti-]
    CÆ[libri X]</code></pre><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Remember, it is the title page only that is thus mutilated. The ten
books or chapters bear the full name of Apicius, never at any time
does the name of Cœlius</p></div> </div>
