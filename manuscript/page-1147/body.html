minuscule when referring to manuscript. Since it appears
deliberate, it has been preserved as printed.</p><p>Page 9 has a word obscured—"one of three known famous

the word as 'eaters', so the same has been used here.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Page 23 has a reference to a "modern" sauce, A I. There
