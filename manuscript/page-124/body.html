<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Apicius The Writer</h4><p class="  start-chapter">Most of the Apician directions are vague, hastily jotted down,
carelessly edited. One of the chief reasons for the eternal
misunderstandings! Often the author fails to state the quantities to
be used. He has a mania for giving undue prominence to expensive
spices and other (quite often irrelevant) ingredients. Plainly,
Apicius was no writer, no editor. He was a cook. He took it for
granted that spices be used within the bounds of reason, but he could
not afford to forget them in his formul√¶.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Apicius surely pursues the correct culinary principle of incorporating
the flavoring agents during the process</p></div> </div>
