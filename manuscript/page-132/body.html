<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">the very perusal of
this quasi-Apician <em>mixtum compositum</em> repels every desire to partake
of it. We are justly tempted to condemn it as being utterly
impossible. Yet every day hundreds of thousand portions of it are sold
under the name of special fruit salad with <em>mayonnaise mousseuse</em>. The
above mystery No. 1 is the justly popular tartar sauce.</p><p>Thus we could go on analyzing modern preparations and make them appear
as outlandish things. Yet we relish them every day. The ingredients,
obnoxious in great quantities, are employed with common sense. We are
not mystified seeing them in print; they are usually given in clear
logical order. This is not the style of Apicius, however.</p></div> </div>
