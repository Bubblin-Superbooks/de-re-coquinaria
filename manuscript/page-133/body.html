<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">sufficiently proven by the <em>lingua
coquinaria</em>, the vulgar Latin of our old work. In our opinion, the
ancient author did not consider it worth his while to give anything
but the most indispensable information in the tersest form. This he
certainly did. A comparison of his literary performance with that of
the artistic and accomplished writer of the Renaissance, Platina, will
at once show up Apicius as a hard-working practical cook, a man who
knew his business but who could not tell what he knew.</p><p>Like ever so many of his successors, he could not refrain from
beginning and concluding many of his articles with such superfluities
as "take this" and "And serve," etc., all of which shows him up as a
genuine cook. These articles, written in the most laconic language
possibleâ€”the language of a very busy, very harassed, very hurried
man, are the literary product of a cook, or several of them.</p></div> </div>
