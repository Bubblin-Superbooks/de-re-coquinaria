   <em>UVÃ† UT DIU SERVENTUR</em></p><p>TAKE PERFECT GRAPES FROM THE VINES, PLACE THEM IN A VESSEL AND POUR
RAIN WATER OVER THEM THAT HAS BEEN BOILED DOWN ONE THIRD OF ITS
VOLUME. THE VESSEL MUST BE PITCHED AND SEALED WITH PLASTER, AND MUST
BE KEPT IN A COOL PLACE TO WHICH THE SUN HAS NO ACCESS. TREATED IN
THIS MANNER, THE GRAPES WILL BE FRESH WHENEVER YOU NEED THEM. YOU CAN
ALSO SERVE THIS WATER AS HONEY MEAD TO THE SICK.</p></div> </div>
