<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>During his first trip through Italy and on a visit to Pompeii he
conceived the idea of depicting some day the table of the Romans and
of making the present translation. He commenced to gather all the
necessary material for this work, which included intensive studies of
the ancient arts and languages. Meanwhile, he continued his hotel work
also, quite successfully. At the age of twenty-four he was assistant
manager of the fashionable Hotel Bristol, Vienna.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">However, the necessities of existence prevented his giving that time
and study to art, which is necessary if it was to become a real
career. In Vienna he found music, drama, languages, history,
literature and gastronomy, and met interesting people from all parts
of the globe. While the years at Vienna were the happiest of his life,
he had a distaste for the "superheated, aristocratic and military
atmosphere." It was at that city that he met the man who was
responsible for his coming to America.</p></div> </div>
