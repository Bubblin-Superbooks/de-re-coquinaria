from _salsum insicium_, cut salt meat; old French
_salcisse_, _saulcisse_, modern French _saucisse_,
meaning sausage. This is a confirmation of the meaning
of the word _salsum_—meaning primarily salt meat, bacon
in particular. It has survived in modern French
terminology in _salés_ more specially _petits
salés_—small rashers of bacon. _Salsum_ has caused much
confusion in some later formulæ. Cf. notes to Nos. 148,
150, 152.
