<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre><code>[1] G.-V. _Vulvulæ Botelli_; Sch. _Vulvulæ isiciata_;
Tor. _De Vulvulis et botellis_. See note No. 3.

[2] V. "_Entrées_" out of respect for the ancients who
used them as such; today we would class such dishes
among the "_hors d'œuvres chauds_."

[3] V. _Vulvula_, dim. for _vulva_, sow's matrix. Cf.
_vulva_ in dictionary. Possible, also possible that
_volva_ is meant—a meat roll, a croquette.

[4] V. Combinations of chopped nuts and pork still in
vogue today; we use the green pistachios.

[5] V. The casings which were filled with this forcemeat
may have been the sow's matrices, also caul. The
original is vague on the point.</code></pre><p>[60] LITTLE SAUSAGE
