kind; (French, Boudin, English, Pudding). Originally
made of raw blood, they are in fact, miniature blood
sausage. The absence of meat in the present formula
makes me believe that it is not complete, though hard
boiled yolk when properly seasoned and mixed with the
right amount of fat, make a tasty forcemeat for sausage.

[2] Tor. _Botellum sic fades ex oui_; Sch. and G.-V.
_sex ovi_â€”the number of eggs is immaterial.
