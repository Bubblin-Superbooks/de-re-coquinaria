[2] V. Ingenious method to skin tender root vegetables,
still in vogue today. We remove the skin of tender young
root vegetables, carrots, beets, etc., by placing them
in a towel, sprinkling them with rock salt and shaking
them energetically. The modern power vegetable peeler is
really built on the same principle, only instead of salt
(which soon melts) carborundum or rough concrete
surfaces are used, against which surfaces the vegetables
are hurled by the rotary motion; often enough, too much
of the skin is removed, however.</code></pre><p>[70] BEETS Ã€ LA VARRO
