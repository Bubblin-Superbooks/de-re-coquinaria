[3] Modern English recipes for stewed pumpkin resemble
this Apician precept, but America has made a really
palatable dish from pumpkin by the addition of eggs,
cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger—spices which the insipid
pumpkin needs. The ancient original may have omitted the
eggs because Apicius probably expected his formula to be
carried out in accordance with the preceding formulæ.
Perhaps this is proven by the fact that Tor. continues
the Rose Pie recipe with _et cucurbita patina sic fiet_.</code></pre></div> </div>
