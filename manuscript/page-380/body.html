our ways of making this fine dish.

This again illustrates the laconic style of the ancient
author. He omitted to say that the fish, when cooked,
was placed on the service platter and that the juices
remaining in the sauce pan were tied with one or two egg

strained and poured over the fish at the moment of
serving. This is perhaps the best method of preparing
fish with white meat of a fine texture. Pink or darker
fish do not lend themselves to this method of
preparation.</code></pre></div> </div>
