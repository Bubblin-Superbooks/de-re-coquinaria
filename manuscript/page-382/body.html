<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="  "><code>[1] Tac., Tor. _sic_. List., G.-V. _p. de apua sine
apua_—a dish of anchovies (or smelts) without
anchovies. Tor. formula bears the title _patina de
apua_, and his article opens with the following
sentence: _patin de abua sive apua sic facies_. He is
therefore quite emphatic that the dish is to be made
with the _abua_ or _apua_ (an anchovy) and not without
_apua_, as List. has it. Lan. calls the dish: P. _de
apabadiade_, not identified.

[2] Tor. _impones ad uaporem ut cum ouis meare
possint_—warning, get along with the eggs, i.e. beware
of boiling them for they will curdle, and the experiment
is hopelessly lost. List. however, reads _meare possint_
thus: _bullire p._—boil (!) It is quite plain that Tor.
