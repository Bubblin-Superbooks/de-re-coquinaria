Lacertis_. The _lacertus_, according to List., is a much
esteemed salt fish; not identified. List. _et al._ seem
to be mistaken in their reading of _lacertis_ for
_laridis_. This work stands for salt pork, from
_laridum_ and _lardum_ (French, _lard_; the English
_lard_ is applied to the rendered fat of pork in
general). Cf. notes to â„ž No. 41.
