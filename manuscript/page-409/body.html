[3] Tor. _duratos_—_hard_—no sense here, probably a
misprint of the d. List. _curatos_—carefully treated,
"cured," processed.

[4] _Salsum coctum_, cf. notes to ℞ No. 148; Goll.,
Dann.—sprinkle [the fish] with salt.... Like Lister's
error in the preceding formula it would be a great
blunder to add salt to a cured fish already saturated
with salt to the utmost. Cf. also note 2 to ℞ Nos.
41, 148.

[5] Virtually a repetition of ℞ No. 149, except for
the addition of the pork.</code></pre><p>[151] ANOTHER FISH DISH, WITH ONIONS
