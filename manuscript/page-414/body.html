[4] This formula would be intelligible and even
gastronomically correct were it not for this word
"fish." However, we cannot accept Lister's reading
_lacertis_. We prefer the reading, _laridis_, bacon. The
French have another term for this—_petits salés_. Both
this and the Torinus term are in the plural. They are
simply small strips of bacon to which Torinus again
refers in the above formula, _salsum, coctum in media
pones_—put the bacon, when done, in the center (of the
dish). Regarding _salsum_ also see note to ℞ No. 41.

The above dish resembles _ragoût fin en coquille_, a
popular Continental dish, although its principal
ingredients are sweetbreads instead of brains.</code></pre><p class=" stretch-last-line ">BROILED MULLET
