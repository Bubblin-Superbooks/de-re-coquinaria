voracity; a sea fish, sea pike, or sea bass; perhaps
akin to our barracuda, wolfish both in appearance and
character. Sch. _Perca labrax_ Lin.

fillets, placed in an oiled pan, the ingredients spread

the open fire.

properly belong among the Excerpta of Vinidarius and
which are found at the end Book X by Apicius.</code></pre><p>[159] A DISH OF SORB-APPLE, HOT OR COLD
