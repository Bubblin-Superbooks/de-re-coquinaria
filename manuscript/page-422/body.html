disastrous. The fish, if such was used, was probably
first poached in the broth, wine and oil, and when done,
removed from the pan. The _fond_, or remaining juice or
gravy, was subsequently tied with the egg yolks, and
this sauce was strained over the fish dressed on the
service platter, the _œnogarum_ sparingly sprinkled
over the finished dish. This would closely resemble our
modern _au vin blanc_ fish dishes; the _œnogarum_
taking the place of our meat glacé.

Another interpretation of this vexatious formula is that
if fish was used, the cooked fish was incorporated with
the raw beaten eggs which were then scrambled in the
pan. In that event this formula resembles closely the
sardine omelette.</code></pre></div> </div>
