Sch. _mala rosea_—rosy or red apple, most likely to be
the correct interpretation. Cf. ℞ Nos. 136 and 167.

The above title has led to the belief that the ancients
made pies, etc., of roses, an idea that was much
ridiculed in England after the publication of Lister's
work in 1705.

We concur with Schuch's interpretation that rosy apples
were used, remembering, however, that the fruit of the
rose tree, the hip, dog-briar, eglantine is also made
into dainty confections on the Continent today. It is
therefore entirely possible that this recipe calls for
the fruit of the rose tree.</code></pre></div> </div>
