List. This specimen is hard to identify because of the
many varieties in the cucumber, squash and the citrus
families. _Citrus_, as a matter of fact, is but a
corruption of _cedrus_, the cedar tree.

We are not sure whether this fruit is to be stuffed with
the ragout and then baked, as is often the custom to do
with such shells; the texts prescribes distinctly to
hollow out the fruit.

The title, implying a "sweet dish" is obviously wrong.

It may be remarked here that Apicius makes no mention of
that marvelous citrus fruit, the lemon, nor of the
orange, both of which are indispensable to modern
cookery.</code></pre></div> </div>
