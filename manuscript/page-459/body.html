pitch, properly dated and labeled, often remaining for many years.
Some writers mention wine thus kept for a hundred years; the porosity
of the earthen crocks, often holding fifty gallons or more, allowed
evaporation, so that the wine in time became as thick as oil or honey,
which necessitated diluting with water.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Smaller amphoræ, with various vintages readily mixed, were kept cool
in "bars" very similar to our present ice cream cabinets, ready for
service for the guests in tavern rooms.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Elaborate dippers (see our illustration) were used to draw the wine
from the amphoræ.}</p></blockquote></div> </div>
