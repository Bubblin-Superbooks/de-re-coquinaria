1896, 11th edition. As a matter of fact, Rebekka Wolf is
outdoing Apicius in strangeness—a case of _Apicium in
ipso Apicio_, as Lister sarcastically remarks of
Torinus.

Rebekka Wolf: ℞ No. 211—wash and boil the young
beans in fat _bouillon_ (Apicius: _oleum et liquamen_)
adding a handful of chopped pepperwort (A.: _piper,
ligusticum_) and later chopped parsley (A.:
_petroselinum_) some sugar (A.: _mel pavo_—little
honey) and pepper. Beans later in the season are cooked
with potatoes. The young beans are tied with flour
dissolved in water, or with roux.

_Id. ibid._, ℞ No. 212, Beans Sweet-Sour. Boil in
water, fat, salt, add vinegar, sugar or syrup,</pre></div> </div>
