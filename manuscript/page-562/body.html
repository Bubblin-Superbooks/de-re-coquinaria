Backhähndl, etc.

[2] Tor. _Leocozymus_; from the Greek _leucozomos_,
prepared with white sauce. The formula for the cream
sauce is lacking here. Cf. ℞ No. 245.

[3] The use of water to clarify the oil which is to
serve as a deep frying fat is an ingenious idea, little
practised today. It surely saves the fat or oil,
prevents premature burning or blackening by frequent
use, and gives a better tasting _friture_. The above
recipe is a mere fragment, but even this reveals the
extraordinary knowledge of culinary principles of
Apicius who reveals himself to us as a master of
well-understood principles of good cookery that are so
often ignored today. Cf. Note 5 to ℞ No.</pre></div> </div>
