breaded, or that the pieces of chicken be turned in

that the chicken must be crisp, dry, that is, not
saturated with oil, which of course every good fry cook

the platter, with the fried chicken inside, or the sauce
in a separate dish, we have here a very close
resemblance to a very popular modern dish.
