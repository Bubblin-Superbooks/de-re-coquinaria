object in the right hand of Athene has created considerable conjecture
but has never been identified.</p><p>Hildesheim Treasure.}</p><img width = "99%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/de-re-coquinaria/master/assets/images/cdar25.png" /><p>FRYING PAN, OVAL</p><p></p><p>This oblong pan was no doubt primarily used in fish cookery. An oblong
piece of food material fitted snugly into the pan, thus saving fats
and other liquids in preparation. Around the slender handle was no
doubt one of non-heat-conducting material. The shape and the lip of
the pan indicate that it was not used for "sauter." Ntl. Mus., Naples,
