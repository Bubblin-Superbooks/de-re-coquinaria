Gœree, the artist and engraver, has invented it. The general
tidiness differs from contemporary Dutch kitchens and the clothing of
the cooks reminds one of Henry VIII, who issued at Eltham in 1526 this
order: "... provide and sufficiently furnish the kitchens of such
scolyons as shall not goe naked or in garments of such vilenesse as
they doe ... nor lie in the nights and dayes in the kitchens ... by
the fire-side...."—MS. No. 642, Harleian Library.}</p></blockquote><p>END OF BOOK VI.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
