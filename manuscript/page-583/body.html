<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre><code>[1] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.

[2] The texts have two formul√¶; by the transposition of
the two sentences the formula appears as a whole and
one that is intelligible from a culinary point of view.

[3] The texts have: _in aqua recte friguntur_; the
_acqua_ presumably belongs to the cumin pickle. To fry
in water is not possible.</code></pre></div> </div>
