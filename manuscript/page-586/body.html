[3] Reinsenius, _ficatum_ [_or sicatum_] _projecore_.

According to the invention of Marcus Apicius, pigs were
starved, and the hungry pigs were crammed with dry figs
and then suddenly given all the mead they wanted to
drink. The violent expansion of the figs in the
stomachs, or the fermentation caused acute indigestion
which killed the pigs. The livers were very much
enlarged, similar to the cramming of geese for the sake
of obtaining abnormally large livers. This latter method
prevailed in the Strassburg District until recently when
it was prohibited by law.</code></pre><p>ANOTHER WAY
