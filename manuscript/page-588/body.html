THE MOMENT OF SERVING [3].</p><pre><code>[1] A piece of meat from the neck of a food animal,
beef, veal, pork; a muscular hard piece, requiring much
care to make it palatable, a "pot roast."

[2] A roasting pan especially adapted for braising tough
meats, with closefitting cover to hold the vapors.

[3] Tor. combines this and the foregoing formula. G.-V.
_siccum calidum_, for hot gravy. Perhaps a typographical
error for _succum_.</code></pre></div> </div>
