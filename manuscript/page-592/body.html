hard to differentiate between them and the
_offelæ_.—_Cupedia_ (Plaut. and Goll.), nice dainty
dishes, from _cupiditas_, appetite, desire for dainty
fare. Hence _cupedinarius_ (Terent.) and _cupediarius_
(Lamprid.) a seller or maker of dainties, a
confectioner.

[2] _Damascena_; they correspond apparently to our
present stewed (dried) prunes. It is inconceivable how
this sauce can be white in color, but, as a condiment
and if taken in small quantity, it has our full
approval.

[3] G.-V. _agitabis_, i.e. stir the sauce with a whip of
thyme and origany twigs. Cf. note to following.</code></pre></div> </div>
