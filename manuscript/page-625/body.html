IN HONEY AND SERVED [4].</p><pre class="  "><code>[1] _Dulcia_, sweetmeats, cakes; hence _dulciarius_, a
pastry cook or confectioner.

The fact that here attention is drawn to home-made sweet
dishes may clear up the absence of regular baking and
dessert formul√¶ in Apicius. The trade of the
_dulciarius_ was so highly developed at that time that
the professional bakers and confectioners supplied the
entire home market with their wares, making it
convenient and unprofitable for the domestic cook to
compete with their organized business, a condition which
largely exists in our modern highly civilized centers of
population today. Cf. "Cooks."
