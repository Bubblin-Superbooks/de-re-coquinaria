adjustable to the size of food to be cooked thereon. Pans of various
sizes would rest on these rods. In the rear two openings to hold the
caccabus, or stewpot, of which we have four different illustrations.
The craticula usually rested on top of a stationary brick oven or
range. The apparatus, being moveable, is very ingenious. The roughness
of the surface of this specimen is caused by corrosion and lava
adhering to its metal frame. Found in Pompeii. Ntl. Mus., Naples,
121321; Field M., 26145.}</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">A stewpot, marmite, kettle. The cover, rising from the circumference
