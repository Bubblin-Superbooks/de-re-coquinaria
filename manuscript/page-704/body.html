equivalent _Jardinière_, a very common name for all
dishes containing young vegetables. However, in the
above rich formula there is very little to remind us of
the gardener's style, excepting the last part of the
formula, enumerating a number of fresh vegetables. It is
unthinkable for any gourmet to incorporate these with
the rich dressing. The vegetables should be used as a
garnish for the finished roast. This leads us to believe
that the above is really two distinct formulæ, or that
the vegetables were intended for garniture.

[2] This extraordinary and rich dressing, perfectly
feasible and admirable when compared with our own
"Toulouse," "Financière," "Chipolata," can be palatable
only when each component part is cooked</pre></div> </div>
