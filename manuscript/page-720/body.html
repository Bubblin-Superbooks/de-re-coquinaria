This forcemeat is supposed to be used for the stuffing
of the hare; it, being boned, is rolled up, the
forcemeat inside, the outside covered with caul or
paper, fastened with skewers. Danneil's interpretation
suggests the thought that the raw hare's meat is cut
into squares which are filled with forcemeat, rolled,
wrapped, and roastâ€”a roulade of hare in the regular
term.</code></pre><p class=" stretch-last-line ">[392] BOILED HARE
