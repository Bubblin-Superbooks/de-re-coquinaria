of the South of Europe is the size of a rat, arboreal
rodent, living in trees.

Galen, III, de Alim.; Plinius, VIII, 57/82; Varro, III,
describing the _glirarium_, place where the dormouse was
raised for the table.

Petronius, Cap. 31, describes another way of preparing
dormouse. Nonnus, Di√¶teticon, p. 194/5, says that
Fluvius Hirpinus was the first man to raise dormouse in
the _glirarium_.

Dormouse, as an article of diet, should not astonish
Americans who relish squirrel, opossum, muskrat, "coon,"
etc.</code></pre></div> </div>
