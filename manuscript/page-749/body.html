IF DESIRED RICHER, ADD RAISINS.</p><pre><code>This appears to be a sauce to be poured over the boiled
ray.

Today the ray is boiled in water seasoned strongly and
with similar ingredients. When done, the fish is allowed
to cool in this water; the edible parts are then
removed, the water drained from the meat, which is
tossed in sizzling brown butter with lemon juice,
vinegar and capers. This is _raie au beurre noir_, much
esteemed on the French seaboards.</code></pre></div> </div>
