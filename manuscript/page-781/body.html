Marseilles.

[2] Baiæ, a very popular seaside resort of the ancients
located in the bay of Naples. The stew was named after
the place. Horace liked the place but Seneca warned
against it.

[3] Tor. _spondylos_; List. _sphondylos_—scallops.
Both terms, if used in connection with the shellfish are
correct. Lister in several places confuses this term
with _spongiolus_—mushroom. This instance is the final
vindication of Torinus, whose correctness was maintained
in ℞ Nos. 41, 47, 115, _seq._; 120, 121, 183, 309,
_seq._</code></pre><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>EXPLICIT APICII THALASSA LIBER NONUS</em></p></div> </div>
