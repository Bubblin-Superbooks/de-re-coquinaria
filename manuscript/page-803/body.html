Bouillabaisse.

[3] The laconic style in which all these fish
preparations are given, is very confusing to the
uninitiated. We assume that most of these ingredients
were used to season the water in which to boil fish; or,
to make a _court-bouillon_, a fish-essence of the bones
and the trimmings of the fish, in which to poach the
sliced fish. The liquor thus gained was reduced and in
the moment of serving was bound with roux or with yolks,
and the fish was masked with this sauce. The exceptions
from this rule are, of course, in cases where the fish
was broiled or fried.</code></pre><p>SAUCE FOR BROILED MURENA
