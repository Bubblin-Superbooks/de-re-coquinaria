Identical with the two previous editions except for very minor
variants. The rubrication is not completed here. Fine initials were
painted in the vacant spaces by hand; the small letter in the center
of the square being the cue for the rubricator. This practice, a
remnant from the manuscript books, was very soon abandoned after the
printing of books became commercialized.}</p></blockquote><p>{Transcription:</p><p>Laseratum             Oxyporum    Oxygarum digestibile
