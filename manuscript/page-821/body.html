[1] _Brevis cyboru_ could be nicely and appropriately
rendered with "Menu,"—something minute, short,—but
this list is not a menu in our modern sense. It is an
enumeration of recipe names, a summary of dishes
contained in the excerpts.

There is considerable variation in the spelling of the
names here and in the following. Syllables ending with
"u" are invariably abbreviations of "um."</code></pre></div> </div>
