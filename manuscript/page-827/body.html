with the ten books of Apicius, even if some recipes resemble each
other ..." and other researchers have expressed the same opinion.
Vollmer, however, does not share this view.</p><p>If I may be permitted to concur with Vollmer, I would say that the
excerpts are quite Apician in character, and that in a sense they fill
certain gaps in the Apicius text, although the language is strongly
vulgarized which may be readily expected to be the case in the age of
Vinidarius.</p></div> </div>
