<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Note</h3><p class="  start-chapter">The original text used a Prescription Take symbol, â„ž, to indicate
recipe numbers. There are also some characters with a macron or
overline (straight line) above them. You may need to adjust your
font settings for these to display properly.</p><p>The many inconsistencies in hyphenation and use of accents and
ligatures have been preserved as printed, with a few exceptions.
Variable and archaic spelling has also been preserved. A full
list of amendments and other notes follow the end of the book.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">A considerable number of the recipe and page</p></div> </div>
