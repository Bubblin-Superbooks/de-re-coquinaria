numbered.</p><p>{Illustration: COLOPHON, MILAN EDITION, 1498</p><p>From the Lancilotus edition of Apicius, printed by Signerre, Milan,
1498, the first dated edition. The poems by Mota and Salandus are
identical with the colophon of the 1503 Venice edition.</p><p>Note the date of this colophon and observe how easily it can be read
for "the 8th day of January, 1490" which date is attributed to our
Apiciana No. 2. This edition, as is noted, is doubtful, although
several bibliographers speak about it.}</p><p>{Transcription:</p><p>Antonius mota Ad vulgus.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Plaudite sartores: cætari: plaudite ventres
