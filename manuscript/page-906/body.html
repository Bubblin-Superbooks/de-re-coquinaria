Library.</p><p>Our facsimile of the 1498 colophon shows how easily its date can be
mistaken for "the 8th day of January, 1490," Bernhold's very date!
Evidently an error of this kind made victims of Preus, Bernhold and
Fabricius (if, indeed, he quoted it) and caused us some ardent
searching among dusty tomes. We have therefore come to the conclusion
that either this 1490 edition disappeared between the year 1787 and
our time or else that it never existed.</p><p>NO. 4, A.D. 1503, VENICE</p><pre class="  "><code>APITII CELII DE RE COQUINARIA LIBRI DECEM. || COQUINARIÆ
