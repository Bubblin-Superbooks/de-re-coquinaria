Tridino alias Tacuinus, Venice, 1503. This is the second dated edition
of Apicius, resembling very closely the undated edition and also the
Milan edition, printed by Signerre 1498, the first to bear a date.
Same size as the original. This is a first timid attempt at giving a
book a title page. Most books printed before this date have no title
pages.}</p></div> </div>
