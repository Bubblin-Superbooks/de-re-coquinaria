enjoyment of the classic art of eating. So far, they always provided

ordinary salesmanship, our <em>maîtres d'hôtel</em> have not educated our

demand. And our new aristocracy has been too busy with limousines,
golf, divorces and electricity to bemourn the decline of classic
cookery.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Most people "get by" without the benefit of classic</p></div> </div>
