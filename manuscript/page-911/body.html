p. 110 to p. 117, comprising fourteen recipes for "condimenta" and

concluded on p. 139; but with hardly any interruption nor with any
very conspicuous title on this page there follows the work of Platina:

down with the words: "P. [_sic_] Platinæ libri decimi et vltimi
Finis" and the date, as mentioned. The last page blank.</p><p>{Illustration: TITLE PAGE, LYONS, 1541</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">This edition, printed in Lyons, France, in 1541, by</p></div> </div>
