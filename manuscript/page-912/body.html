collectors pride themselves in owning one or several of them. Of the
well-known collections of cookery books the most outstanding perhaps
is that of Theodor Drexel, of Frankfurt on the Main, who owned nine
different editions of Apicius. The Drexel catalogue forms the basis of
a bibliography—Verzeichnis der Litteratur über Speise und Trank bis
zum Jahre 1887, bearbeitet von Carl Georg, Hannover, 1888, describing
some 1700 works.</p><p>The Drexel collection, combined with that of Dr. Freund, is now in the
Staatsbibliothek in Berlin and is undoubtedly the finest collection of
its kind.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Another famous collection of cookery books is described in My Cookery
