<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">TORINO
INTER || PRETE.</code></pre><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The lower center of the title page is occupied by the Gryphius
printer's device, a griffin standing on a box-like pedestal, supported
by a winged globe. On the left of the device: "virtute duci," on the
right: "comite fortuna"; directly underneath: "Apvd Seb. Gryphivm,
Lvgvdvni [_sic_], 1541." Sm. 8vo. Pages numbered, commencing with
verso of title from 2-314. Sheets lettered same as Basel edition; on
verso of title "Katalogos" etc. exactly like Basel. Page 3 commences
with the same epistola dedicatoria. This dedication and the entire
corpus of the book is printed in an awkward Italic type, except the
captions which are in 6 pt. and 8 pt. Roman. The book is quite an
unpleasant contrast with the fine Antiqua type and the generous
margins of the Basel edition. Some woodcut initials but of small
interest. The index, contrary to Basel, is in the back.</p></div> </div>
