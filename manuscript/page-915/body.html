fictitious title given to his work by Torinus, who probably possessed
one of the earliest editions of Platina's De honesta Voluptate,

and asks his patron's protection, is concluded with the date, Basile√¶,
v. Idus Martias, Anno M. D. XLI., while the copy described by Vicaire
appears to be without this date. Vicaire also says that the sheets of
his copy are not numbered. He also reads on the title "Lvgdvni, 1541"
which is spelled correctly, but not in accordance with the original.
