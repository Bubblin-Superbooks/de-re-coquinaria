<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Then, good food was expensive
while good labor was cheap. Now, good food is cheap while skilled
labor is at a premium. Somehow, good, intelligent "labor" is reluctant
to devote itself to food. That is another story. The chances for a
good dinner seemed to be in favor of the Romansâ€”but only for a
favored few. Those of us, although unable to command a staff of
experts, but able to prepare their own meals rationally and serve them
well are indeed fortunate. With a few dimes they may dine in royal
fashion. If our much maligned age has achieved anything at all it has
at least enabled the working "slave" of the "masses" to dine in a
manner that even princes could hardly match in former days, a manner
indeed that the princes of our own time could not improve upon. The
fly in the ointment is that most modern people do not know how to
handle and to appreciate food. This condition, however, may be
remedied by instruction and education.</p></div> </div>
