<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">mention whatsoever of the doubtful
1490 Milan edition (our No. 2).</p><p>Vicaire, col. 33, mentioning this edition citing Bernhold, quotes
Brunet as doubting the existence of this 1490 edition, but we fail to
notice this expression of doubt since our Brunet is altogether silent
on the subject, same as the other bibliographers.</p><p>Vicaire, col. 28-29, quotes Brunet as saying that the undated Apicius
(our No. 1) despite its sub-titles of Suetonius, contains only the
Apicius text, a statement confirmed by Pennell.</p><p>A search of all the available works of Joh. Alb. Fabricius—Bibliotheca
Latina [Classics], Hamburg, 1722, Bibliographia Antiquaria, ib. 1760
and the Bibliotheca Latina mediæ et infimæ [middle ages], ib. 1735, has
failed to reveal a trace of the 1490 Apicius, displayed by Bernhold, as
described by Fabricius and as seen by Preus in the Nürnberg Municipal
Library.</p></div> </div>
