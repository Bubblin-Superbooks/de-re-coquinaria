<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Unfortunately, the present work did not reach us until after ours had
gone to press. The text of this edition, the first to appear in the
French language, could not be considered in our work, for this reason.</p><p>However, a few casual remarks about it may be in order here.</p><p>A hasty perusal reveals the disconcerting fact that the editor has
been influenced by and has followed the example of Schuch by the
adoption of his system of numbering the recipes. We do not approve of
his inclusion of the excerpts of Vinidarius in the Apician text.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The observations presented in this edition are rich and varied. The
material, comprising the <em>Introduction</em> and also the explanatory
notes to the recipes are interesting, copious and well-authenticated.
The editor reveals himself to be a better scholar, well-read in the
classics, than a practical cook, well-versed in kitchen</p></div> </div>
