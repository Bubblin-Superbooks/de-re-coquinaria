Anne. Printed in London in 1705 by the famous printer, William Bowyer.
This is one of the rarest of the Apician books, the edition being
limited to 120 copies. It has been said that the second edition
(Amsterdam, 1709) was limited to 100 copies, but there is no evidence
to that effect.}</p><p>{Transcription:</p><p>APICIANA</p><p>APICII CŒLII
