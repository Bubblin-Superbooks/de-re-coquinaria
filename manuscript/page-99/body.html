suo sibi_! and sometimes though far less frequently,
_succus suus_. This phrase is curious enough in itself
to deserve illustration. It is true old fashioned
Plautian Latinity, and if other proof were wanting would
of itself demonstrate the genuineness of the Apician
text."</code></pre><p class=" stretch-last-line ">This scholar goes on quoting from Plautus, <em>Captivi</em>,</p></div> </div>
